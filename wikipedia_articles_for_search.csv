[[File:2022 Winter Paralympics cauldron at Yanqing Winter Olympic Cultural Square (20220313142125).jpg|thumb|One of the four cauldrons used during the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics]]
The '''2022 Winter Paralympics''' ({{zh|s=2022年冬季残疾人奥林匹克运动会|p=2022 Nián Dōngjì Cánjí Rén Àolínpǐkè Yùndònghuì}}), commonly known as '''Beijing 2022''' ({{zh|s=北京2022}}), were an international [[Winter sport|winter]] [[multi-sport event|multi-sport]] [[parasports]] event held in  [[Beijing]], China from 4 to 13 March 2022. This was the 13th [[Winter Paralympic Games]], as administered by the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC).

Beijing was selected as the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics in 2015 at the [[128th IOC Session]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia; taking into account its hosting of the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]], Beijing is the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics as well as the Summer and Winter Paralympics. This was the overall second Paralympics in China. It was the last of three consecutive Paralympics hosted in [[East Asia]].

These Games featured 564 athletes representing 46 [[National Paralympic Committee]]s (NPCs), competing in 78 medal events across six sports. 

Participation in the Games was impacted by the ongoing [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russian invasion of Ukraine]]; the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) condemned Russia for violating the [[Olympic Truce]], and the IPC ultimately banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing.

While the IPC initially announced that the countries' athletes would be allowed to compete independently under the Paralympic flag, it backtracked on 3 March 2022 – the eve of the opening ceremonies – following threats of a boycott by multiple NPCs, and announced that Belarusian and Russian athletes would be prohibited from competing. The Belarusian and Russian delegations competed at a [[We Are Together. Sports|replacement event]] from 17 to 21 March in [[Khanty-Mansiysk]], Russia. Armenia, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan also competed at the replacement event.

Host nation [[China at the 2022 Winter Paralympics|China]] finished at the top of the medal table, winning a total of 61 medals, of which 18 were gold, setting a new record as the most successful Asian country at a single Winter Paralympics with the most total medals, gold, silver, and bronze. [[Ukraine at the 2022 Winter Paralympics|Ukraine]] also made their best historical performance and finished in second place with 29 medals, of which 11 were gold, and [[Canada at the 2022 Winter Paralympics|Canada]] retained the third place achieved in 2010, 2014 and 2018 with a total of 25 medals, of which eight were gold again."

{{Main|Bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics}}
As part of a formal agreement between the [[International Paralympic Committee]] and the [[International Olympic Committee]] first established in 2001, the winner of the bid for the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] was also to host the 2022 Winter Paralympics.

Beijing was selected as the host city of the 2022 Winter Olympics after beating [[Almaty]] by four votes on 31 July 2015 at the [[128th IOC Session|128th]] [[IOC Session]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia.<ref name=GuardianHost/>

The opening ceremony was held on 4 March 2022 at the Beijing National Stadium; it was directed by [[Zhang Yimou]], with the theme ""Blossoming of Life"".

During his opening remarks, IPC president [[Andrew Parsons (sports administrator)|Andrew Parsons]] condemned the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russian invasion of Ukraine]] and the circumvention of the [[Olympic Truce]] by Russia, emphasising that Paralympic athletes compete with, and not ""against"", each other, and that ""the 21st century is a time for dialogue and diplomacy, not war and hate"".<ref name="":0"" /> The final torchbearer was four-time Chinese [[para-athletics]] gold medalist [[Li Duan]], who mounted the torch at the centre of a large snowflake sculpture.<ref name="":0"" />"

Seventy-eight events in five sports were held during the 2022 Winter Paralympics, two lower than 2018. In June 2019, the IPC dropped four of the six proposed disciplines for women's snowboarding (leaving only LL2 banked slalom and snowboard cross), as they did not meet the required viability benchmarks during the 2019 World Para Snowboard Championships.

== Participating National Paralympics Committees ==

In total, 46 [[National Paralympic Committee]]s have qualified athletes. [[Azerbaijan at the 2022 Winter Paralympics|Azerbaijan]], [[Israel at the 2022 Winter Paralympics|Israel]] and [[Puerto Rico at the 2022 Winter Paralympics|Puerto Rico]] made their Winter Paralympic debut, while [[Liechtenstein]], [[Estonia]], and [[Latvia]] returned for the first time since [[1994 Winter Paralympics|Lillehammer 1994]], [[2002 Winter Paralympics|Salt Lake 2002]], and [[2006 Winter Paralympics|Turin 2006]], respectively. Seven National Paralympic Committees that participated in PyeongChang 2018 did not send their delegations to Beijing: [[Armenia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[North Korea]], [[Serbia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkey]] and [[Uzbekistan]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}} Additionally, [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]] were excluded from participation or prohibited from participating. A new record of 138 female athletes were scheduled to compete, which was five more than the 133 female athletes in [[2018 Winter Paralympics|2018]].<ref name=""record_number_of_female_athletes_paralympics_2022""/>

On 24 February 2022, the first day of the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russian invasion of Ukraine]], the [[International Olympic Committee]] condemned the breach of the [[Olympic Truce]] (which lasts from the beginning of the Olympics through the end of the Paralympics) by Russia. President of the IPC [[Andrew Parsons (sports administrator)|Andrew Parsons]] stated that getting the [[Ukraine at the 2022 Winter Paralympics|Ukrainian team]] to Beijing would be a ""mammoth challenge"". The IOC called for the flags of both Russia and Belarus not to be displayed at any international sporting event, the latter due to the [[Belarusian involvement in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|country's support of Russia's aggression]], and officials of the [[Belarus Olympic Committee]] having been accused of political discrimination against Belarusian athletes. The [[Russia]]n flag has already been prohibited from international sporting events through December 2021 due to sanctions by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA), and its athletes would have originally participated under the name ""RPC"" ([[Russian Paralympic Committee]]).

On 28 February 2022, the IOC Executive Board further called for Russian and Belarusian athletes not to be included in or allowed to participate in any international sporting event. On 2&nbsp;March 2022, the IPC declared that Russian and Belarusian athletes would be included independently under or allowed to participate independently under the Paralympic flag, with their results not counting in the medal standings. As a result of criticism by several National Paralympic Committees, who threatened to boycott the Games, the IPC announced on 3&nbsp;March 2022 that they would reverse their earlier decision, banning Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing at the 2022 Winter Paralympics. In response, [[Vladimir Putin]]'s press secretary [[Dmitry Peskov]] condemned the IPC for the decision. In response, Russia hosted a replacement event named [[Winter Paralympic Games ""We Are Together. Sports""|""We are together, Sport""]] that was attended by Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Armenia.

[[Azerbaijan at the 2022 Winter Paralympics|Azerbaijan]] was scheduled to make its debut, but its only athlete was seriously injured at the last training session on the eve of the start and did not compete in his event. However, the country participated in the Parade of Nations in both the opening and closing ceremonies.

The district consists of 9 subdistricts of Beijing's city proper.<!--Needs to be checked-->

Although the hills around [[Yunju Temple]] may also be called ''Shijingshan'', they have Chinese characters different from those of the district and hence are unrelated to Shijingshan ''District''.

There were 437 total coronavirus cases detected and reported by the [[Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games]] since 23 January 2022. All cases at the 2022 Olympics are counted towards China's COVID case count rather than the home country of the person.

There were 26 cases in the time period after the 2022 Winter Olympics, which includes the 2022 Winter Paralympics. In total, more than 2.5 million tests for COVID-19 were conducted.<ref name=""final_figures_reveal_that_beijing_2022""/>"

== Background ==

{{Main|2022 Winter Olympics|2022 Winter Paralympics|COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China}}
On 31 July 2015, Beijing was selected as the [[List of Olympic Games host cities|host city]] of the [[2022 Winter Olympics]], officially the XXIV Olympic Winter Games, during the [[128th IOC Session|128th]] [[IOC Session]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia. It was elected over Almaty. The games were the second Olympic Games to be held in China following Beijing 2008 (Summer). As a result, Beijing will also be the first city to host both the Summer and the Winter Games for the Olympics and Paralympics.

On 1 December 2019, the first known case of coronavirus disease 2019 ([[COVID-19]]), a [[novel virus]] caused by [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]] (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in [[Wuhan]]. The virus has since spread to other parts of the host country and around the world, becoming the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], one of the [[deadliest pandemics in history]].

During the [[2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics]], there were 464 COVID-19 cases linked to the games. Despite the strict COVID-19 containment efforts including bubbles and claims of being the safest sporting event, the Beijing Winter Olympics reported only 27 fewer cases than the similar scale event during the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, which had less stringent COVID-19 containment measures."

In the [[2021 World Figure Skating Championships]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, Japan secured three quotas in both the men's and ladies singles competitions, and one each in the pairs and ice dance competitions.

The Japan won bronze medals in the [[Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Team event|team event]], which were not awarded at the Olympics due to a pending investigation into a Russian doping scandal. The investigation was still ongoing as of 2023, with the final decision announced in early 2024. The [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) recommended the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) to upgrade the Japan team to silver, which it did, bringing the country's silver medal tally to seven.

[[Fanny Smith]] of Switzerland, the 2018 bronze medalist, initially crossed the line in third place and thought she had won the bronze medal. [[Daniela Maier]] of Germany finished fourth. However, following a 10-minute review by race judges, Smith was penalised for a clash with Maier, so at the awards ceremony on 17 February 2022 Maier was awarded the bronze.

On 26 February 2022, after the end of the Olympic Games, following an appeal from Fanny Smith, the FIS Appeals Commission made the decision to overturn the FIS Jury decision. As a result of winning the appeal, Smith was promoted to third place, while Maier officially finished in fourth place, which was reflected on the FIS website.

FIS has no right to make a decision on the return and redistribution of medals, as this issue is in the exclusive competence of the IOC, therefore, in its decision, the FIS Appeals Commission did not mention any words about the medals and their redistribution, and the IOC has the last word in this issue. On 13 December 2022, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] decided both competitors will be awarded duplicate bronze medals and share joint third place. At the moment, the IOC has not yet updated the data on its website.

{{Short description|Parade of Nations during the opening ceremony of the XXIV Winter Olympiad}}

{{2022 Winter Olympics}}
During the '''Parade of Nations''' within the [[Beijing]] [[2022 Winter Olympics]] [[2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] on February 4, athletes and officials from each participating country marched in the [[Beijing National Stadium]] preceded by their flag and placard bearer bearing the respective country's name. Each flag bearer was chosen either by the nation's [[National Olympic Committee]] or by the team of athletes themselves."
"2022 Winter Olympics Parade of Nations

==Parade order==

By tradition, [[Greece at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Greece]] entered first as the originator of the Olympics, and [[China at the 2022 Winter Olympics|China]] entered last as host. Per a new rule introduced by the [[International Olympic Committee]] at the [[2020 Summer Olympics]], [[Italy at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Italy]] entered second-to-last as the upcoming host of the [[2026 Winter Olympics]]. All nations in between entered in the order of the host nation's language, [[Simplified Chinese]].

As part of sanctions due to the [[Russian doping scandal]], Russia was not allowed to directly use its name or flag, and entered under the acronym ""ROC"" after the [[Russian Olympic Committee]] and its flag.

Announcers in the stadium read off the names of the marching nations in [[Mandarin Chinese]] (the official language of the host country), [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] (the official languages of the Olympics) with music accompanying the athletes as they marched into the stadium.

According to the current version of the [[Olympic Charter]], each nation had the option of having two flag bearers (a man and a woman) in an effort to promote gender equality."
"2022 Winter Olympics Parade of Nations

==Parade order==

===Sort order===

As Chinese characters do not have an alphabetical order, they were sorted based on [[stroke count]]. Specifically:
* Characters with fewer strokes march earlier, so [[San Marino]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|圣马力诺}}) marched before [[Kyrgyzstan]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|吉尔吉斯斯坦}}) because {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wikt:圣|圣]]}} has 5 strokes and {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wikt:吉|吉]]}} has 6 strokes.
* If the initial characters have the same number of strokes, then the stroke orders of the two characters are grouped in the order 橫竖撇捺折 (horizontal/vertical/left falling/right falling/fold). For example, [[Denmark]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|丹麦}}) marched before [[Brazil]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|巴西}}) because {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wikt:丹|丹]]}} has four strokes in the order {{nowrap|㇓㇆㇔㇐}} (3541), while {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wikt:巴|巴]]}} has four strokes in the order {{nowrap|㇕丨㇐㇟}} (5215).
** The second characters are not compared, even though {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wikt:麦|麦]]}} has more strokes than {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wikt:西|西]]}}.
* While it is possible to have a pair of characters with the same stroke count and the same stroke order groups, this did not occur during the parade. If the initial characters are identical, the second characters of each nation are used, and so on."
"2022 Winter Olympics Parade of Nations

==List==

The following is a list of each country's flag bearer. The list is sorted by the sequence that each nation appeared in the Parade of Nations. The names are given in their official designations by the [[IOC]], and the Chinese names follow their official designations by the [[Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games]].

[[Norway]] competed at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], China, from 4 to 20 February 2022. The Norwegian team consisted of 84 athletes. [[Kjetil Jansrud]] and [[Kristin Skaslien]] were the country's flagbearers during the [[2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]]. Biathlete [[Marte Olsbu Røiseland]] was the flag bearer during the [[2022 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]].

Three days before the closing ceremony, Norway won its 14th gold medal, thus matching its record performance of [[Norway at the 2018 Winter Olympics|2018]], as well as Canada's [[Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010]] and Germany's [[Germany at the 2018 Winter Olympics|2018]] results. Norway won its 15th gold medal on 18 February, thus breaking the record.
This should be seen in light of the ongoing medal inflation, e.g., from 16 gold medals in [[1924 Winter Olympics medal table|1924]] to 109 in 2022. However, Norway also holds the medal inflation-adjusted records: in [[1936 Winter Olympics medal table|1936]], Norwegian athletes won 41% of all events (7 out of 17), in [[1928 Winter Olympics medal table|1928]], 43% (6 out of 14). As of 20 February 2022, this percentage for the 2022 Games stands at ~14%."

==Cross-country skiing==

{{main article|Cross-country skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Cross-country skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification}}
Norway qualified the maximum of eight male and eight female cross-country skiers.

The 2018 champion in the 30&nbsp;km skiathlon, [[Simen Hegstad Krüger]], qualified for the Olympics but tested positive for COVID just before the games. Even though he had no symptoms, he was not allowed to fly to China with the rest of the team to get a chance to defend the title. Earlier, [[Heidi Weng]] and [[Anne Kjersti Kalvå]] also tested positive and had to miss the Olympics.
However, six days before the 50&nbsp;km race was to start, Krüger had negative tests and was allowed to participate. He then won the bronze medal in the race, which then had been shortened to 28&nbsp;km caused by weather conditions.

==Men's tournament==

{{main|Ice hockey at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's tournament}}
The tournament featured twelve countries, eight qualifying through the [[IIHF World Ranking]], the host [[China men's national ice hockey team|China]], and three through qualifying tournaments. The format remained the same as the previous three Olympics; three groups of four compete in three games to determine seeding, each played every other team in their group, followed by four rounds of elimination games. Each group winner received a bye into the second round, along with the highest ranked of the remaining teams. The remaining eight teams played an eliminating qualification game to advance to the quarter-final round. Each quarter-final winner advanced to the semi-finals with the winners playing for the gold medal and the losers playing for the bronze. With the cancellation of the [[2020 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships]], the groups were established on 24 April 2020, using the IIHF world rankings where seeding counted for the ranking points in unplayed tournaments.

On 10 July 2020, the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA) and [[National Hockey League]] agreed to a renewed [[collective bargaining agreement]], which includes a provision opening the possibility for the NHL to explore participation at the 2022 and 2026 Winter Olympics. On 22 July 2021, the NHL released a 2021–22 schedule that included an Olympic break, but the league also announced that a final agreement had not yet been reached regarding Olympic participation of NHL players in 2022. On 3 September 2021, an agreement was made to allow NHL players to compete.

On 22 December 2021, the NHL and the NHLPA announced that NHL players would not be participating in the men's ice hockey tournament at the 2022 Games. [[COVID-19]] has forced a change in the NHL schedule. With approximately 50 games postponed, the NHL was to use the Olympic break to make up its own postponed games rather than have the players compete in the Olympics."

The following is about the qualification rules and the quota allocation for the [[Luge at the 2022 Winter Olympics|luge]] at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]."
"Luge at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Qualification rules==

The qualification is based on the cumulative points of the Olympic Season from 1 July 2021 to January 10, 2022. A total of 106 quota spots are available to athletes to compete at the games. A maximum 35 men, 35 women, and 18 doubles teams will initially qualify.  Each NOC can enter a maximum of three men, three women, and two doubles. The host nation has the right to enter a competitor in the men's, doubles, and women's competitions provided they meet minimum standards. The team relay will consist of all nations who can form a relay team from qualified athletes.

In the men's singles, all nations with an athlete in the top 50 qualified one slot. If there were remaining spots left, the second best athlete of each nation in the top 32 was awarded an additional quota, with the third best being awarded a quota if there were any remaining spots. For the women, instead of the top 50, it was top 40, and in the doubles it was top 25, with the second sled being required to be in the top 28 (if any spots were left). Each country could enter a maximum of 10 athletes (three each in the singles events and two doubles sleds for a total of four athletes).

On December 17, 2021, the [[International Luge Federation]] announced that the qualification system was changed. The qualification system was changed due to training runs being cancelled at the first World Cup, and equipment not being delivered to the following World Cups. The new system will see athletes qualify based on their top four results during the World Cup season, (as opposed to the previous all seven results counting).<ref name=""Qualificationsystems""/>"

The '''Olympic qualification event''' (branded as the '''2021 Olympic Qualification Event presented by Asito''' for sponsorship reasons) is an international [[curling]] tournament that was held from 5–18 December 2021 in [[Leeuwarden]], [[Netherlands]]. 

The first international curling tournament to be hosted by the Netherlands, the event was the final [[Curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification|qualifier]] for [[curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics]], and was established as part of changes to the qualification process necessitated due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. The tournament was played between the men's, women's, and mixed doubles teams that qualified for the 2020 or 2021 World Curling Championships, but had yet to qualify for the Olympics, joined by additional teams who qualified through a [[2021 Pre-Olympic Qualification Event|pre-qualification tournament in November]].<ref name="":0"" />

The top three [[National Olympic Committee|National Olympic Committees]] (NOCs) in the men's and women's tournaments, and the top two NOCs in the mixed doubles tournament, advanced to the Olympic curling tournament. Denmark, Italy, and Norway qualified to the men's tournament. Great Britain, Japan, and South Korea qualified to the women's tournament, while Australia and the United States qualified in mixed doubles."

==Sponsorship controversy==

Live streaming of the mixed doubles event was cancelled by some international broadcasters, including [[NBC Olympic broadcasts|NBC]] and [[NHK]], due to the sponsorship of a Dutch [[sex toy]] store, EasyToys, whose logo appeared on the ice. Following the mixed doubles event, the ads were replaced with the statement ""#equalityforall"" for the women's and men's events."

===Playoffs===

Three teams, Japan, South Korea and Latvia qualified for the play-offs to decide the final two places at Beijing 2022. The teams finishing second and third, South Korea and Japan, face off in the first Qualifier; the winner qualifies for Beijing. The loser then faces fourth-placed Latvia in the second and final qualifier, with the winner of that match taking the final place in Beijing.

==Doping controversy surrounding Russia==

{{see also|Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Women's singles#Doping controversy}}

The medal ceremony for the team event, where the [[Russian Olympic Committee athletes at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Russian Olympic Committee]] (ROC) won gold, originally scheduled for 8 February, was delayed over what [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) spokesperson Mark Adams described as a situation that required ""legal consultation"" with the [[International Skating Union]]. Several media outlets reported on 9 February that the issue was over a positive test for [[trimetazidine]] by the ROC's [[Kamila Valieva]], which was officially confirmed on 11 February. Valieva's sample in question was taken by the [[Russian Anti-Doping Agency]] (RUSADA) at the [[2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships]] on 25 December, but the sample was not analyzed at the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) laboratory where it was sent for testing until 8 February, one day after the team event concluded.

Valieva was assessed a provisional suspension after her positive result, but upon appeal, she was cleared by RUSADA's independent Disciplinary Anti-Doping Committee (DAC) on 9 February, just a day after receiving the provisional suspension. Following formal appeals lodged by the IOC, the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU), and WADA to review RUSADA DAC's decision, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) heard the case on 13 February, and removal of her provisional suspension was upheld on 14 February, ahead of her scheduled appearance in the women's singles event beginning 15 February. Due to Valieva being a minor at the time, as well as being classified as a ""protected person"" under WADA guidelines, RUSADA and the IOC announced on 12 February that they would broaden the scope of their respective investigations to include members of her entourage (e.g. coaches, team doctors, etc.).

On 14 February, the CAS declined to reinstate Valieva's provisional suspension and ruled that she would be allowed to compete in the women’s singles event. The CAS decided that preventing her from competing ""would cause her irreparable harm in the circumstances"", while noting that any medals won by Valieva at the Beijing Olympics would be withheld pending the results of the continuing investigation into her doping violation. The accommodating decision from the court, still subject to further and on-going investigation, was made on three grounds: 1/ Due to her age, she is a ""Protected Person"" as per WADA Code, subject to different rules than adult athletes; 2/ Athlete ""did not test positive during the Olympic Games in Beijing; 3/ ""There were serious issues of untimely notification of the results, ... which impinged upon the Athlete’s ability to establish certain legal requirements for her benefit"". The IOC announced that the team event medal ceremony, as well as the women's singles flower ceremony and medal ceremony if Valieva were to medal, would not take place until the investigation is over, and there is a concrete decision whether to strip Valieva and the ROC of their medals. To allow for the possibility that Valieva's results may be disqualified, the IOC asked the ISU to expand the qualifying field for the women's singles free skating by one to 25, contingent upon Valieva being one of the top 24 skaters after the short program.

On 15 February, after the women's short program, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Valieva's sample tested positive for an additional two substances, hypoxen and [[Carnitine|L-Carnitine]], which are not on the banned list, in addition to trimetazidine. Antidoping officials called the discovery of multiple substances in any athlete's sample ""highly unusual"", particularly in an athlete as young as Valieva. [[Travis Tygart]], the chief executive of the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]], called the combination of three heart medications a ""trifecta of substances...[which] seem to be aimed at increasing endurance, reducing fatigue and promoting greater efficiency in using oxygen"". By the end of the Beijing Olympics, a total five athletes were reported for doping violations. By 9 March 2022, Tygart of the [[USADA]] further reported that Valieva had not requested that her ""B"" sample be tested, apparently accepting the results of initial testing and relying on her explanation that the banned substance trimetazidine belonged to her grandfather and only accidentally contaminated or became mixed into her own use of allowed nutrients and supplements. Tygart further stated that as a minor Valieva could still be either fully exculpated or given a warning concerning her testing positive depending on the extent of findings in the on-going [[RUSADA]] investigation of doping. According to Tygart, an adverse finding against her as a first offense could still be assessed as a two year suspension, which is half of the suspension time which could be assessed for adults.

Although Russia as a country is currently banned from participating in international skating events due to the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]], Valieva has continued to compete within Russian borders without being hindered by RUSADA as recently as the Russian Grand Prix held in October 2022. In mid-November, WADA requested that CAS take up the review of the Valieva case with an eye towards a 4-year suspension of Valieva, which would exclude her from competition at the next Winter Olympics, and to rescind her first place performance at the previous Beijing Olympics because, ""the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) did not meet a WADA-imposed Nov. 4 deadline to deliver a verdict on Valiyeva's case."""

British athletes won a total of two medals (one gold, one silver). This result was described as a 'disappointment' by [[UK Sport]]. Despite the underwhelming games, Great Britain ranked 19th on the medal table, the same ranking as the previous three Winter Olympic Games."
"Great Britain at the 2022 Winter Olympics

==Medal and performance targets==

In July 2018, [[UK Sport]] announced a preliminary target of 5–12 medals for the Games, which would at least sustain the level of success experienced at the previous two Games, in both of which 5 medals were won. On 13 January 2022, UK Sport confirmed that they have a target of 3–7 medals for the Games.

==Summary==

{{unsourced section|date=February 2022}}
The team won two medals (a tally below the 3-7 medal target set by UK Sport) during the course of the Games, both in [[curling]]. This is also three medals less than the team achieved at both the 2014 and 2018 Winter Olympics. The [[Curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Women's tournament|women's team]], skipped by Eve Muirhead won gold, beating Japan 10-3 in the gold medal game, and the [[Curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's tournament|men's team]], skipped by Bruce Mouat won silver, having lost the gold medal match to Sweden 5-4 after an extra end. The gold medal from women's curling team ensured Great Britain won at least one gold medal for a fourth consecutive Winter Olympics. However, there was no repeat of the successes of previous Olympic Games in the sliding sports, particularly in [[Skeleton (sport)|skeleton]], where Great Britain failed to win a medal - the first time this had happened since skeleton was included as an event. 2018 bronze medallist [[Laura Deas]] finished 19th. The team had other high hopes with [[Charlotte Bankes]] being one of the favourites to win the Women's Snowboard Cross event, but she was beaten in the quarter-finals and finished ninth overall. [[Isabel Atkin|Izzy Atkin]] who won a bronze in 2018 in the Women's Ski Slopestyle also dented the team's hopes of further medals, after she withdrew from the games due to injury."
"Great Britain at the 2022 Winter Olympics

==Administration==

On 24 May 2020, [[Team GB]] announced that former modern pentathlete [[Georgina Harland]] would become the first woman to act as Chef de Mission for the British team at an Olympic Games. A bronze medal winner at the 2004 Games in Athens, she went on to serve as a deputy Chef de Mission at both the 2016 and 2020 Summer Games in Rio and Tokyo respectively."

[[Gus Kenworthy]] (Freestyle skiing) competed for the United States at the 2014 and 2018 Winter Games winning a silver medal at the former. In 2019 he announced that he would seek to represent Great Britain at the 2022 Games. He is a dual national having been born in [[Chelmsford]] to a British mother and American father.

Former sprinter [[Montell Douglas]] (Bobsleigh) became the eighth British athlete to compete at both the Summer and Winter Games. She was preceded by [[Ethel Muckelt]] (Figure skating at both Games) and [[Percy Legard]] (Modern pentathlon/Nordic combined) in the inter-war period. Like Douglas five other athletes have transferred from athletics to bobsleigh in more recent decades: [[Colin Campbell (Olympian)|Colin Campbell]]; [[John Herbert (athlete)|John Herbert]]; [[Marcus Adam]]; [[Philip Harries]]; and [[Allyn Condon]]. She was the first British woman to compete in different sports at the Summer and Winter Games. Douglas was also one of two athletes together with [[Jaqueline Mourão]] of Brazil to have competed at both Beijing 2008 and 2022.

== History ==

[[File:Winter Olympic decoration at Guichuan Square, Yanqing (20220414124724).jpg|thumb|left|Statues of the mascots at Guichuan Square in [[Yanqing, Beijing]]]]
The mascot design competition was launched on 8 August 2018. A total of 5,816 designs were submitted for further review and ten were shortlisted. The mascots were unveiled on 17 September 2019. Bing Dwen Dwen and Shuey Rhon Rhon were selected over eight other designs.

During the Olympic games, medalists were given a stuffed version of Bing Dwen Dwen at a ceremony immediately after the conclusion of their event, while medals were awarded at a later ceremony combining winners from multiple events.

Some critics of [[Chinese government]] say that [[China]] has used social media bots and fake accounts to promote the mascot with Chinese media pointing to this inauthentic activity as evidence of the mascot's popularity."

[[File:Shuey Rhon Rhon and Bing Dwen Dwen at Yanqing Winter Olympic Cultural Square (20220313143320).jpg|thumb|right|340px|Volunteers dressed in costumes of the two mascots at the 2022 Winter Olympics]]
Bing Dwen Dwen is a [[giant panda]] with a suit of ice, a heart of gold and a love of [[winter sports]]. ""Bing"" means ice and embodies purity and strength, the characteristics of the Winter Olympics. ""Dwen Dwen"", which means health, liveliness and cuteness, conforms to the overall image of pandas and symbolizes the strength, tenacity and inspiring Olympic spirit of Winter Olympic athletes. The colorful ring around Bing Dwen Dwen's face is inspired by the ""ice ribbon"" of the national speed skating hall of the Beijing Winter Olympics. The heart on Bing Dwen Dwen's palm is a warm welcome to friends all over the world. Bing Dwen Dwen's full-body ""shell"", which helps the panda to skate, snowboard and ski alongside the Olympic athletes, is a tribute to embracing new technologies for a future with infinite possibilities, the bright colours of the halo around its face are a representation of the latest advanced technologies of the ice and snow sport tracks at the Games, while the heart on its left palm symbolises China's hospitality for athletes and spectators at the Winter Olympics. Some netizens believe Bing Dwen Dwen's design may have also been inspired by the traditional Chinese winter treat [[tanghulu]] (糖葫芦) as the suit of ice resembles the clear candy coating. 

Shuey Rhon Rhon is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[Paper lantern|Chinese lantern]]. Lanterns represent harvest, celebration, warmth and light. The wishful shape at the top symbolizes auspicious happiness. The continuous pattern of the dove of peace and the [[Temple of Heaven]] symbolize the peaceful friendship and highlights the characteristics of the place where the events are held. The decorative pattern incorporates the traditional Chinese [[Papercutting|paper-cutting]] art. The snow on the face represents the meaning of ""a fall of seasonable snow gives promise of a fruitful year"" (瑞雪兆丰年). It also reflects the anthropomorphic design and highlights the mascot's cuteness.

Bing Dwen Dwen is the main Olympic mascot. Shuey Rhon Rhon is the [[Paralympic symbols|Paralympic]] mascot."

A total of six bids were initially submitted for the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]. Four of the bids were subsequently withdrawn by 1 October 2014, citing either the high costs of hosting the Games or the lack of local support, leaving [[Almaty, Kazakhstan]] and [[Beijing, China]] as the only two remaining candidate cities. [[Beijing]] was then elected as the host city at the [[128th IOC Session]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], on 31 July 2015."
"Bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics

"Bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics

==Candidate cities venues list==

Note that the selected candidate cities have slightly changed venues plan in the final proposal to the IOC. Almaty moved technical alpine skiing events from [[Shymbulak]] to Tau, and completely removed both Kok Zhaylau and Ak-Bulak ski resorts, previously proposed for snowboarding and freestyle skiing events. Beijing dropped both Taiwu and Wanlong ski resorts, and proposed hosting snowboarding and freestyle skiing events in the two venues (A and B) in Genting Snow Park.

"Bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics

==Candidate cities overview==

On 15 November 2013, the IOC announced the list of the six applicant cities. On 7 July 2014, the IOC announced that there were three remaining applicant cities that would move on to the candidate phase; these were Almaty, Beijing and Oslo.

On 1 October 2014, Oslo withdrew its application after one of the country's governing political parties [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Høyre]] decided not to support the application. The remaining two candidate cities were therefore Almaty and Beijing.

Both of the candidate cities suggested hosting the Games between February 4–20, 2022. The Paralympics will be held from March 4–13. While another city suggested hosting the Games between February 11–27, 2022. The Paralympics will be held from March 11–20."

{{main|Almaty bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics}}
Since 2011, the [[National Olympic Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan]] has been considering a bid for the 2022 games in [[Almaty]], the former longtime [[capital city]] and still the largest city and financial centre of the country. Kazakhstan hosted the [[2011 Asian Winter Games]]. Almaty will host [[2017 Winter Universiade]]. The current Kazakh capital [[Astana]] considered to joint bid with Almaty but the idea was later declined. On 17 August 2013, Almaty announced they were bidding for the 2022 Games. Under the slogan ""Keeping it Real"", Almaty has emphasized her traditional winter setting with tall mountains and plenty of natural snow coverage as well as compactness — most venues are within half an hour's travel through Alpine scenery.

Presenting Kazakhstan's bid at the final event in Kuala Lumpur, Prime Minister of Kazakhstan [[Karim Massimov]] made a speech with the key message that Almaty was ""not a risk choice for 2022"", but ""a golden opportunity to prove that smaller advancing nations can successfully host the winter games"". He called to the IOC core values saying that letting Almaty host the Games was ""a golden opportunity to showcase the real long-term power of Olympic legacy for a region that has never hosted the Games"".
In the final voting Almaty lost to Beijing by only 4 votes."

{{main|Beijing bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics}}

On 5 November 2013, the [[Chinese Olympic Committee]] announced that it would submit a bid for [[Beijing]] to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Beijing (where the indoor ice sports and the ceremonies would take place), was the host city of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. [[Zhangjiakou]] would host the outdoor snow events.

Before the final voting in Kuala Lumpur Beijing's bid was presented by [[Yang Lan]], a renowned former CCTV host, who said sports and fitness were becoming a new fashion trend in China. In her speech she focused on China's economy and its ability to support every commitment it made ""protecting long time financial viability and the reputation of the Games""."

{{main|Oslo bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics}}

On 6 November 2013, the [[Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports]] announced that Oslo would be submitted as the Norwegian candidate for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. Oslo last hosted the [[1952 Winter Olympics]], and Norway last hosted the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lillehammer]]. On 1 October 2014 the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] decided that they would not support a bid for the games citing costs and lack of public support. A vast number of polls were conducted, and since April 2014 support had varied between 24% and 37%. The days leading up to the deliberation in the Conservative Party had consisted of a series of negative developments for the bid. Those negative developments included the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] saying ""no"" through a grass root vote, a poll showing that even within the [[Norwegian Confederation of Sports]] the majority of members opposed the bid, an external revision which clarified that the newly suggested cheaper budget was unrealistic and public scrutiny on [[IOC]]´s 7000 pages of demands.

Norway rejected the Olympic committee's application for government funding to hold the event in Norway after the private organization IOC made a large number of demands which caused a scandal in Norway. The demands notably included ""diva-like demands for luxury treatment"" for the IOC members themselves, such as special lanes on all roads only to be used by IOC members, a cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family, car and drivers for all IOC members, adjusted traffic lights, free cell phones, seasonal fruits, and all ""OL-shaped"" and ""Olympic Appearance” furniture. The IOC also demanded ""control over all advertising space throughout Oslo during the Games, to be used exclusively by official sponsors."""

*{{flagicon|POL}} '''[[Kraków]], Poland'''
{{main|Kraków bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics}}

On 7 November 2013, the [[Polish Olympic Committee]] announced they submitted a bid to the IOC for the 2022 Winter Olympics, together with [[Zakopane]], Poland, and [[Jasná]], a village in central [[Slovakia]], near the Polish border. If the bid had been successful, it would have been the first time either Poland or Slovakia hosted the Olympics. [[Zakopane]] previously [[Zakopane bid for the 2006 Winter Olympics|bid to host]] the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] but failed to become a candidate. Kraków's bid was submitted to a [[Kraków referendum, 2014|local referendum]] held on 25 May 2014, which had a negative result. After that Kraków discontinued the application on 26 May 2014.
* {{flagicon|UKR}} '''[[Lviv]], Ukraine'''
{{main|Lviv bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics}}

The [[National Olympic Committee of Ukraine]] officially submitted a bid for [[Lviv]] to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games on 5 November 2013. On 30 June 2014, however, the IOC announced that Lviv would ""turn its attention to an [[Bids for the 2026 Winter Olympics|Olympic bid for 2026]], and not continue with its application for 2022. The decision comes as a result of the [[2013–2015 Ukrainian crisis]]"" which seriously influences [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|Lviv and the country]].
*{{flagicon|SWE}} '''[[Stockholm]], Sweden'''
{{main|Stockholm bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics}}

On 11 November 2013, the [[Swedish Olympic Committee]] announced that it had submitted a bid, but on 17 January 2014, [[Stockholm]] dropped the bid due to lack of political support. [[Åre]], about {{convert|610|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Stockholm, was scheduled to host the [[alpine skiing]] events. Stockholm previously hosted the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] and hosted [[Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics|equestrian events]] of the [[1956 Summer Olympics]], but this was the first time the Swedish capital had bid for the Winter Olympics. Had it won, it would have been the first city to host both the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics, a distinction that ultimately went to Beijing."

*{{flagicon|AUT}} {{flagicon|ITA}} '''[[Tyrol–South Tyrol–Trentino Euroregion]], Austria/Italy'''
:The former parts of the [[County of Tyrol]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] in Austria, [[South Tyrol]] and [[Trentino]] in Italy were considering a joint bid as the [[Euroregion Tyrol–South Tyrol–Trentino]] for the 2022 Olympics. The capital of Tyrol, [[Innsbruck]], has already hosted Olympic Winter Games twice, in [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]] and [[1976 Winter Olympics|1976]] as well as the [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics]]. However, the common legislative assembly of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[South Tyrol]] and [[Trentino]] rejected the proposal during its session on 30 March 2011.

*{{flagicon|BIH}} '''[[Sarajevo]], Bosnia and Herzegovina'''
:After the announcement that Sarajevo would host the [[2017 European Youth Winter Olympic Festival]], [[Fahrudin Radončić]], President of the [[Union for a Better Future of BiH|Union for a Better Future of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a [[List of political parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina|political party]], said that Bosnia and Herzegovina would apply to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, which hosted the [[1984 Winter Olympics]] when it was part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

*{{flagicon|CAN}} '''[[Quebec City]], Canada'''
:Quebec City initially expressed interest in bidding. In September 2011, Quebec City mayor [[Régis Labeaume]] ruled out bidding for 2022. However, the city may bid for another Winter Games in the future. Former IOC President [[Jacques Rogge]] stated that he believes that the 2026 Winter Olympics would be a realistic option for the city to organize the games. Quebec has a problem finding a mountain for the downhill event, as the planned location [[Le Massif]] was not approved.

*{{flagicon|CHI}} '''[[Santiago]], Chile'''
:After an interview with then [[International Olympic Committee]] president [[Jacques Rogge]] during the [[2012 Olympic Games]] in London discussions were started about how to organize [[Winter Olympics]] in the [[southern hemisphere]] for the first time. During the interview conditions in the [[Andes]] were highlighted as very suitable to stage snow sports events but a lack of existing venues for the ice sport events was identified as well.

*{{flagicon|FRA}} '''[[Nice]], France'''
:After Nice's failure to secure the French nomination for the [[2018 Winter Olympics]],  mayor of Nice [[Christian Estrosi]] announced in 2011, and again during the [[2012 Summer Games]], that his city remained interested in bidding. The [[French Olympic Committee]] will make a decision after they get an autumn report about the failure of previous Olympic bids by France, but the president of the Committee also said that the probability of bidding for 2022 is weak.

*{{flagicon|FIN}} '''[[Tahko]], [[Kuopio]], and [[Helsinki]], Finland'''
:During the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver, Jouko Purontakanen, the Secretary General of the Finland Olympic Committee, said Finland could host the games alone in [[Tahko]], [[Kuopio]], and [[Helsinki]], if the project for artificial heightening of the Tahko hill progresses. Nothing followed from these suggestions: the heightening of Tahko hill did not progress since 2010 due to environmental concerns, and no Nordic countries indicated an interest to bid with Finland since the discussions in Vancouver.

*{{flagicon|GER}} '''[[Munich]], Germany'''
:Following Munich's [[Munich bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics|failed bid]] to host the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], plans for a second attempt were made. On 30 September 2013, ''[[Deutscher Olympischer Sportbund]]'' (the German [[National Olympic Committee]]) announced its intention to submit a bid for Munich to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. However, these plans were cancelled on 10 November 2013 when a majority of residents in the Munich area opposed the bid in referendums held in Munich, [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] and the Bavarian districts of [[Berchtesgadener Land]] and [[Traunstein District|Traunstein]] (where the competitions would have taken place). In each locality, a majority had voted against bidding: 51.2% in Munich, 51.6% in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, 54.0% in Berchtesgadener Land, and 59.7% in Traunstein. Opponents pointed to the high costs for hosting the Olympics, environmental issues, and criticism of commercialization of sports, particularly [[International Olympic Committee#Controversies|the IOC]].

:In order to address concerns voiced about the 2018 bid, the 2022 Games would have been located at four different places. Only Alpine Skiing and Ski Jumping competitions would have been held at Garmisch-Partenkirchen (the host city of the [[1936 Winter Olympics]]), whilst Nordic Skiing and Biathlon events would have taken place at existing facilities at [[Ruhpolding]], thus minimizing the land use. The [[Königssee bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track]] would have become another important venue. Indoor ice skating events and ski/snowboard half-pipe competitions would have been held at the [[Olympiapark, Munich|Olympiapark]] in Munich, the main site of the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]; and the [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Olympic Stadium]] would have been used for the opening and closing ceremonies.

*{{flagicon|NZL}} '''[[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]]—[[Christchurch]], New Zealand'''
:Queenstown, New Zealand's main winter sports centre, has toyed with the idea of bidding for hosting rights of the Winter Olympics in the past, notably a 2007 report suggesting a bid (co-hosting with [[Dunedin]]) for the 2018 games. A proposal to bring the games to the [[Southern Hemisphere]] for the first time in 2022, to be jointly held in Queenstown and Christchurch, has been mooted by a private group, but does not have general support among the country's Olympians and is seen as unlikely to proceed."

==Previously interested in bidding==

*{{flagicon|ROU}} '''[[Brașov]] and [[Prahova Valley]], Romania'''
:The mayor of [[Brașov]], [[George Scripcaru]], said in September 2011 that his city would be interested to bid if the [[2013 European Youth Winter Olympic Festival]] is a success. In 2007, former Romanian Prime Minister [[Călin Popescu Tăriceanu]] announced that the country was considering a bid for the [[Prahova Valley]]. Instead of bidding for 2022, Brașov's mayor, George Scripcaru, announced in November 2013 that Brașov will be bidding to host the [[2020 Winter Youth Olympics]].

*{{flagicon|ESP}} '''[[Barcelona]], Spain'''
:[[Barcelona]], which hosted the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], considered a bid for the 2022 Olympics, but on 25 October 2013, mayor [[Xavier Trias]] announced that ""the conditions"" would not exist yet. Instead, one ""must concentrate to reach the Olympic target [[2026 Winter Olympics|by 2026]]"". On 13 January 2010, then mayor of Barcelona [[Jordi Hereu]] had first announced plans to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. The proposed ""two cluster system"" would have seen the Games being shared with [[La Molina (ski resort)|La Molina]], a ski resort in the [[Pyrenees]]. Indoor sports (as well as the opening, closing and medal ceremonies) would have taken place in Barcelona. On 17 June 2015, mayor [[Ada Colau]] announced Barcelona would not be bidding for the 2026 either, stating it is not a priority project for the city.

*{{flagicon|ESP}} '''[[Zaragoza]], Spain'''
:The Zaragoza-Pyrenees 2022 bid was withdrawn on 7 November 2011 and left Barcelona as sole candidate from Spain to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Officials insisted that Barcelona never regarded Zaragoza as ""a rival, but rather the opposite. Both of us championed the Pyrenees brand in our projects and that's why I believe Aragon will also benefit if Barcelona goes ahead with this bid, because it will have a positive effect on the whole Pyrenees"".

*{{flagicon|SWE}} '''[[Östersund]], Sweden'''
:Ostersund was interested in a potential 2022 bid, but the Swedish Olympic Committee decided not to move forward with bidding due to a lack of financial guarantees from the government. The SOC chairman said that future applications were unlikely because of the government policy. However Sweden has applied with Stockholm as main city, with more arenas and hotels already available, therefore lower cost. Östersund previously bid for the [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994]], [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998]], and [[2002 Winter Olympics]] but lost to [[Lillehammer]], [[Nagano (city)|Nagano]], and [[Salt Lake City]] respectively.

*{{flagicon|CHE}} '''[[Graubünden]] ([[St. Moritz]]/[[Davos]]), Switzerland'''
:The intention to bid was approved in November 2010. On 24 January 2011, the [[Swiss Olympic Association]], announced that five areas across Switzerland had shown interest in bidding to host the 2022 Winter Olympics: [[Geneva]], [[Valais]], [[Graubünden]], [[Lucerne]]/[[Central Switzerland]] and [[Bern]]. After a withdrawal from Central Switzerland, the [[Swiss Olympic Association]] received four bids by 31 March 2011 deadline. The executive committee of the [[Swiss Olympic Association]] decided on 11 August 2011 to put forward a bid of the [[St.Moritz]]/[[Davos]]-area to host the 2022 Olympic Winter Games. St. Moritz hosted the Winter Olympics in [[1928 Winter Olympics|1928]] and [[1948 Winter Olympics|1948]].

:St. Moritz/Davos presented a project that will host all events in the surrounding area of [[Davos]] and [[St. Moritz]]; generally speaking, ""ice events"" in Davos and ""snow events"" in St. Moritz. However, Davos has a hosting tradition in [[cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiing]] and [[snowboarding]], and so one would expect Davos venues for those competitions. After the decision on 11 August 2011 a feasibility study for the Games was announced including the possibility to extend ice events to [[Zürich]]. The organizers decided during a session on 22 December 2011 to go forward with ""St. Moritz 2022"" as the official corporate name of the bid. However at a plebiscite in [[Graubünden]] about the bid on 3 March 2013, the public voted with 41'758 to 37'540 votes (52.66% to 47.43%)  against a credit for the 2022 Olympic Games, meaning that the bid will have to be dropped.

*{{flagicon|USA}} '''Multiple cities, United States'''
:Multiple cities in the United States—such as [[Bozeman, Montana]]; [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]]; [[Reno, Nevada]]; [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]] —initially expressed interest in bidding for the 2022 Games, but the [[United States Olympic Committee|U.S. Olympic Committee]] instead opted to bid for the [[2024 Summer Olympics]] or the [[2026 Winter Olympics]].

* {{flagicon|CAN}} '''[[Vancouver]], Canada'''
:After [[Oslo]] withdrew from hosting the 2022 Games, a replacement host was probably needed instead of awarding to one of the two remaining bidders which would have meant two consecutive Winter Olympics to be held in [[Asia]]. The host of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], Vancouver would be a possible option. Instead, they decided to consider bidding for the [[2030 Winter Olympics]]."

[[Canada]] competed at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]], which were held in [[Beijing]], [[China]], from 4 to 20 February 2022. [[Canada]] has competed in all 24 editions of the [[Winter Olympics]].

On November 17, 2020, two-time Olympic gold medallist in [[speed skating]] [[Catriona Le May Doan]] was named as [[chef de mission]] of the delegation.

The Canadian team consisted of 215 athletes (109 men and 106 women) competing in 14 sports. Canada did not have any representation in the sport of [[Nordic combined at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Nordic combined]]. This was the third-largest Canadian Winter Olympic team after 2014 (222 athletes) and 2018 (225 athletes). The full delegation consisted of 414 people, including athletes, coaches, officials, and staff.

On February 2, 2022, short-track speed skater [[Charles Hamelin]] and hockey player [[Marie-Philip Poulin]] were named as Canada's flagbearers during the [[2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]]. Meanwhile, triple medallist speed skater [[Isabelle Weidemann]] was named the [[2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|closing ceremony]] flagbearer.

The Canadian team won 26 medals, tied with [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010]] for the second-highest total in history. The four gold medals won represented the lowest total since [[Canada at the 1994 Winter Olympics|1994]] and meant the country finished outside the top ten of the medal table for the first time since [[Canada at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]], a span of 34 years.

"India at the 2022 Winter Olympics

== Background ==

The [[Indian Olympic Association]] was recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 1927. However, by this time, they had already competed in three [[Summer Olympic Games]], in [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920]], and [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924]]. The nation made its first Winter Olympics appearance at the [[1964 Winter Olympics]] held in [[Innsbruck]], Austria.{{efn|name= Chamonix}} This edition of the Games marked the nation's eleventh appearance at the [[Winter Olympics]].{{efn|name=IOC}}

While many countries from the west announced a diplomatic boycott of the games as a protest against the human rights abuses in China, India announced that it will not join the boycott and supported China during the tripartite summit involving the two countries and [[Russia]]. But following China's decision to make Qi Fabao, one of its soldiers involved in the [[2020–2021 China–India skirmishes|July 2020 border skirmishes with India]], as a torchbearer during the torch relay held on 7 February 2022 as a prelude to the Olympic games, the Indian [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|Ministry of External Affairs]] announced a diplomatic boycott of the games and that no official from India will attend the opening or closing ceremony of the games. While India claimed that the games are being unnecessarily politicised, China dismissed its concerns.

The Indian delegation consisted of ''[[Head of mission|chef de mission]]'' Harjinder Singh and a lone athlete, [[Arif Khan (skier)|Arif Khan]]. Arif Khan was the country's flag-bearer during the [[2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]], while a volunteer served as the flag-bearer during the [[2022 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]].

[[File:Arif-Mohammed-Khan_headshot.jpg|thumb|[[Arif Khan (skier)|Arif Khan]], the lone Indian participant in the games]]

The basic qualification mark for the [[Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's slalom|slalom]] and [[Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's giant slalom|giant slalom]] events stipulated an average of less than 160 points in the list published by the [[International Ski Federation]] (FIS) as on 17 January 2022. The quotas were allocated further based on athletes satisfying other criteria with a maximum of 22 athletes (11 male and 11 female athletes) from a single participating NOC. Indian [[alpine skiing|alpine skier]] Arif Khan met the basic qualification standard with 127.20 points in the slalom and 137.26 points in the giant slalom categories. Subject to the other criteria, Khan qualified to participate in both the events at the games.

Khan hailed from the [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] region of India. He won a gold medal in the slalom event in his first appearance at the India national championships. He made his international debut at the age of 16 at a junior event in Japan. He won two gold medals in the 2021 [[South Asian Winter Games]] in the slalom and giant slalom events. He had taken part in three [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships]] with his best result being 45th in the giant slalom event at the [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 2021|2021 edition]] in Italy. The games marked Khan's first and only appearance at the Winter Olympic Games. 

In the giant slalom event held on 13 February 2022 at the [[Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre]], Khan completed his first run in 1:22.35 to rank second to last among the 54 competitors. Though he took slightly longer to complete the course during his second run at 1:24.49, he ranked 44th. With a combined time of 2:47.24, he finished 45th in the overall classification. Khan registered the best ever finish by an Indian at the giant slalom event with the previous best being the 65th place achieved by [[Jeremy Bujakowski]] in the [[India at the 1968 Winter Olympics|1968 Winter Olympics]].

In the slalom event held on 16 February 2022, Khan failed to finish his first run, thus earning a [[Did not finish|DNF]]. He started strongly, crossing the first intermediate check-point in 14.40s and the second in 34.41s before he veered off course and failed to go through one of the gates in the final sector, thus crashing out of the competition.

'''Kraków 2022''' was a bid by the [[Polish Olympic Committee]] to hold the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] in [[Kraków]]. On 25 May 2014, the inhabitants of Kraków voted to withdraw the bid in a [[Kraków referendum, 2014|binding referendum]]. After that Kraków discontinued the application on 26 May 2014."

==History==

[[File:Krakau Markt.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Main Square, Kraków]]]]
On 6 March 2010, during a sports facility opening ceremony, Polish President [[Lech Kaczyński]] announced  that he would like his country to be a candidate for 2022 Winter Olympic Games. A month later, on 10 April 2010, he died in a tragic [[Smolensk air disaster|plane crash]], which [[List of casualties of the Smolensk air disaster|killed 96 people]] including him, [[Maria Kaczyńska|his wife]], and the [[Piotr Nurowski|President]] of the [[Polish Olympic Committee]]. Although most snow sport events can be held in Zakopane, some alpine ski events would have to be held in Slovakia, where higher slopes can be found.

On 19 and 20 October 2012, Polish and Slovak NOCs with Kraków city administration had a meeting in which they agreed to submit the bid possibly in 2013 and formed an official alliance. The idea has had an initial acceptance by the Polish government. On 10 May 2013 the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland]] in a vote gave support to the possible bid. On 29 March 2014 [[Elżbieta Bieńkowska]], Poland's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Development, said that the central government would only finance those Games-related infrastructure projects that are planned anyway, independently of the Games. The remaining costs, including sport facilities and the Olympic village, would need to be financed by local authorities.

Kraków confirmed their joint bid with [[Jasná]], [[Slovakia]] to host the 2022 Winter Olympics on November 7, 2013.

Initial opinion polls commissioned by Kraków city authorities returned results in favour of holding the Games. A majority of 68% of participants in a public opinion poll held in June 2013 among Kraków's residents supported the bid, with 25% being against. However, the poll was held before any information on planned spending was made publicly available and before any objections were raised in wider public debate. Opinion polls conducted between 28 October and 2 November 2013 with a sample size of 2,000 respondents throughout Poland resulted in 81% responses in favour across Poland, 79% in Małopolska and 66% in Kraków.

Later opinion polls put public support for holding the Games under doubt. A poll realised by Homo Homini polling center among respondents throughout Poland on 31 March 2014 has indicated that 52% of respondents oppose the Games, 32% are in favour and 16% have no opinion. Another nationwide opinion poll realised for the Polish Radio on 28 April 2014 confirmed that the majority of Poles oppose the Games, with 58,4% against and 32% in favour of holding the Olympic Games in Kraków. A citywide poll in Kraków realised by LoveKraków.pl news website gave 36,3% answers supporting the Games with 63,7% being against. In difference to previous polls from 2013, polls from 2014 were commissioned by news agencies without any interest in holding the Games, not by Kraków local authorities or the bid committee which both have a clear pro-Games agenda. They were ultimately confirmed by the vote in a local [[Krakow local referendum 2014|referendum]] on 25 May 2014.

In late 2013 and early 2014 opposition against Kraków's bid for Olympic Games has gathered momentum. As of 30 March 2014, ""Kraków Przeciwko Igrzyskom"" (""Kraków Against Games"") initiative has won support of over 17,300 Facebook users and gathered over 7900 signatures under an online petition calling for referendum over the bid. Main concerns raised by the critics are expected exorbitant costs, likely cost overruns and the resulting rise in Kraków's debt, as well as the need to build sport facilities of little use beyond the games, in contrast to limited interest of Kraków city authorities in spending public money to improve the quality of life of the population. It has been brought to attention in the national press that the overall economic benefits of holding Olympic games are doubtful, local and national public authorities are almost always laden with excessive debt in result, while the only parties actually benefitting from the Games seem to be the International Olympic Committee and national committees. Criticism voiced by opponents of the Games was partly confirmed already when the Games application has been lodged in mid-March 2014. In difference to previous estimates, the Games application does not include several previously planned transport infrastructure projects, while spending on sport facilities is to be significantly higher than previously planned.

Even though the bid was still in early stages, in February 2014 the bid committee has already drawn much criticism in the national press for employing staff (financed from public money) according to unclear criteria, questionable spending on promotional activities including TV spots and a visit by city officials to the Sochi Olympic Games, as well as awarding the contract for preparation of the Games application to a company involved in the [[Concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games|2010 Commonwealth Games corruption scandal]]. All the cited allegations were later responded by the bid committee.

Kraków's Games application has been lodged on 22 March 2014. Its contents were leaked to the press and published on the internet. The application was criticised for misinforming the International Olympic Committee on climatic and environmental conditions, in particular for failing to provide true information on catastrophic air pollution in both Kraków and Zakopane.

Further controversies arise from the planned location of the Kraków Olympic Park, in particular of the Olympic Village. Its construction would require converting a significant part of the Park Lotników and adjacent green areas into a build-up area with high-rise construction. The envisaged location would involve a reduction of green space despite its crucial importance for Kraków in view of its appalling air pollution record (third most polluted city in the EU).

On 9 April 2014 it was disclosed that Andrzej Walczak, husband of the chairperson of the bid committee Jagna Marczułajtis-Walczak (although himself with no official position in the bid committee), had negotiated to pay journalists for positive coverage of the Games bid. Following widespread reporting of the scandal in the press, Jagna Marczułajtis-Walczak resigned from the bid committee on 12 April."

==History==

===Local referendum and withdrawal===

{{main|2014 Kraków referendum}}
Kraków city council had initially rejected the proposal to submit Kraków's bid to a referendum, in a marked difference to [[Munich]], [[Graubünden]] and [[Oslo]]; however, following increasing opposition, on 24 March 2014, Kraków mayor [[Jacek Majchrowski]] promised that the bid would be submitted to a [[referendum]]. The vote, held on 25 May 2014 and coinciding with the [[2014 European Parliament election in Poland|European Parliament election]], covered four issues: Kraków's Olympic bid, plans to build a metro system, increased monitoring by CCTV cameras and increased spending on bicycle paths. According to Polish law, the result of a local referendum is binding if 30% of eligible voters cast their votes; this criterion was met, as the participation rate was 35.96%. Kraków's bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics was rejected by a majority of 69.72% of the voters. 

On 26 May 2014, Majchrowski explained that in view of the negative result of the referendum, Kraków would withdraw its bid for the Winter Olympics."

== Transport ==

The main airport would be the [[John Paul II International Airport Kraków–Balice]] located about 17&nbsp;km from the Main Olympic Village. Direct trains used to cover the route between [[Kraków Główny]] train station and the airport in 15 minutes but the connection was suspended in early 2014, because the rail track and stations are being renovated and upgraded. 3,647,616 people used the airport in 2013, giving Kraków Airport 15 percent of all air passenger traffic in Poland. Currently, the airport offers 59 connections and is operated by 2 terminals (international T1 and national T2). The [[Katowice International Airport]] is located about 75 minutes from Kraków. The [[Poprad-Tatry Airport]] is located {{convert|60|km|mi}} from Jasná.

Kraków has no suburban rail system, but there are plans to develop such a system.

Kraków is located on the A4 East-West highway. The road distance from Kraków to Jasná is {{convert|175|km|mi}}, at least 2 hours 50 minutes by road in good traffic conditions. The road distance from Kraków to Zakopane is {{convert|110|km|mi}}, 1½ hours by road in good traffic conditions. The Kraków-Zakopane road is notorious for traffic jams in high tourist season and during major sporting events. By 2022 the first {{convert|60|km|mi}} will probably be expressway ([[Expressway S7 (Poland)|S7]])."

Following the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russian invasion of Ukraine]], athletes from Belarus and Russia were considered to compete under a neutral flag without appearing in the medal standings. However, following threats of boycott by multiple delegations, the IPC issued a blanket ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes, expelling them from the Paralympic Games.

There were 78 medal events across six sports.

Athletes from 19 NPCs won medals, leaving 27 NPCs without a medal. Host China topped the medal table for the first time with 61 medals in total, including 18 gold medals. LW11 alpine skier [[Jesper Pedersen (alpine skier)|Jesper Pedersen]] from Norway won four gold medals at the 2022 Games, while LW12 biathlete and cross-country skier [[Oksana Masters]] from the United States won the most individual medals overall, a total of seven medals, comprising three golds and four silvers."

'''Oslo 2022 Winter Olympics''' was a campaign by the private organization [[Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports]] for the right to host the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] in [[Oslo]], although in Norway it was primarily viewed as an application by the Olympic movement for government funding of an Olympic Games that would ultimately be decided by the Norwegian Parliament. The Olympic organisations had already indicated a strong desire that Norway would host the games and provide the necessary funding. Oslo was described as the clear favourite to host the games in international media and was widely expected to be awarded the games, provided that the Norwegian Parliament granted the necessary funding.

Public opinion was strongly against granting government funding to an Olympics after a series of demands by the [[International Olympic Committee]] for luxury treatment of the committee members themselves were revealed in Norwegian media. The demands included special lanes on roads only to be used by IOC members and cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family. The IOC also ""demanded control over all advertising space throughout Oslo"" to be used exclusively by IOC's sponsors, something that is not possible in Norway because Norway is a [[liberal democracy]] where the government doesn't own or control ""all advertising space throughout Oslo"" and has no authority to give a foreign private organization exclusive use of a city and the private property within it. Several commentators pointed out that such demands were unheard of in a [[western democracy]]; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' described the IOC as a ""notoriously ridiculous organization run by grifters and hereditary aristocrats.""

The Olympic movement's bid for government funding was cancelled on October 1, 2014, after the parliamentary caucus of the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] had voted to decline the application for funding. Already, the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]], [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] and [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] were opposed to the bid. Thus, it was no longer possible to get a parliamentary majority for a state guarantee. Ole Berget, deputy minister in the Finance Ministry, said ""the IOC's arrogance was an argument held high by a lot of people.""

The [[IOC]] selected [[Beijing]] as the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics from the two remaining bids at the [[128th IOC Session]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]] on July 31, 2015."
"Oslo bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics

==Background==

[[File:Bakken2.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Holmenkollbakken]], Oslo]]
The [[Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports]], a private organization, originally planned a bid for the [[2018 Winter Olympics]]. Three cities announced interest: [[Tromsø]], [[Trondheim bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics|Trondheim]] and [[Oslo bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics|Oslo]]. After assessing the plans and a technical evaluation, the NOC board voted 7–6 in favor of Tromsø. However, 30 September 2008 an external revision demonstrated the games would cost far more than originally suggested, the total public net cost being estimated at 19,1 billions NOK. This prompted the Norwegian Olympic Committee to withdraw the bid 6 October 2008, citing inter alia responsibility to avoid unwarranted public spending. The decision caused strong negative reactions. Then board member and later president, [[Børre Rognlien]], recognized in 2014 that citing responsibility of public spending was unwise.

In January 2010, [[Gerhard Heiberg]], [[IOC]] member from Norway, announced that the IOC would welcome a bid from Norway to host the Winter Olympic Games.  [[Lillehammer]], host of the [[1994 Winter Olympics]], and the area [[Stavanger]]-[[Bergen]]-[[Voss]] were considered contenders. Tromsø also showed interest. However, Oslo was selected without much public deliberation in October 2011 after the seven major winter sports organizations decided to back the capital. There were negative reactions from several supporters of the Tromsø 2018 bid. MP [[Anne Marit Bjørnflaten]] suggested that Tromsø 2018 was cancelled not due to timing or costs, but geography. On 9 June 2012, the annual assembly of the Norwegian Confederation of Sports voted in favor of the Oslo 2022 bid with a majority of 142–15.

Oslo City Council decided to hold a local public referendum on whether or not the city would move forward with the bid. This was held in Oslo on 9 September 2013. The bid was supported by a majority of 55%. Around the same time, the Socialist Left decided not to back the bid, the first political party to adopt a position on a national level.<ref name="":0""/>"
"Oslo bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics

== Application for state funding and financial guarantee ==

The pivotal issue in pushing the bid forward was obtaining state funding and an unlimited state financial guarantee, as required by the [[Olympic Charter]]. 19 June 2013, the Norwegian Olympic Committee and Oslo had put forward their application for funding and guarantee to the [[Ministry of Culture (Norway)]]. Eventually the cabinet would have to present the issue to the Norwegian parliament, [[Storting]], as the constitution gives the parliament power of the budget. The application for state funding was put through a legally required quality assurance review. [[DNV GL]] conducted the assessment. On December 20, 2013 they presented their conclusion in which they concluded that the bid was without significant weaknesses, and that the public net costs would probably end on 21,7 billion NOK, and with 85% certainty below 25,8 billion NOK. The next step following the review of DNV GL was to have the Ministry of Culture forward the application to the parliament. Before this was executed, the bid had been withdrawn."
"Oslo bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics

== Applicant city phase ==

On 12 November 2013, Oslo sent their formal letter to be an ""applicant city"" in the bidding for the 2022 games. Oslo was joined by five other cities: Beijing, Almaty, Stockholm, Kraków and Lviv. However, Stockholm dropped out of the race two months later due to lack of local political support.

Børre Rognlien had initially stated that the Norwegian Olympic Committee required public support of 60% of the population to move forward with the bid. This was also presented as a requirement from IOC. However, building public support proved hard. Just prior to the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in Sochi, support was lagging at 38%. Despite being a success for Norway in terms of medals, the Sochi games presented a further hit to the Oslo bid. Controversies around the IOC reprimanding the Norwegian cross country skiers for wearing mourning bands, as well as general criticism concerning costs and other issues, made support drop even further. Shortly after Sochi, a poll suggested that support had dropped to 32.6%.

On 9 March 2014, former leader of the Norwegian Confederation of Sports Hans B. Skaset explained how the [[Olympic Charter]] secured IOC control of the event, while leaving the financial risk with the host city. The minister of culture, [[Thorhild Widvey]], responded by declaring that the Norwegian government would reserve itself against the relevant provisions of the [[Olympic Charter]]. Oslo sent the candidate application file on 14 March 2014. Widvey did not – as the IOC requires – provide a full guarantee of respect for the Olympic Charter. Instead, Widvey wrote that their guarantee should ""not be understood to mean that the Government has agreed to comply with all provisions of the Olympic Charter"". However, this was withdrawn by the end of April after a short exchange of letters with the IOC, who rejected such a reservation.

4 May 2014, the Progress Party (junior coalition partner in government) voted no to provide a state financial guarantee for the Olympic bid at their annual conference. Prime Minister [[Erna Solberg]] declared the following day that this did not affect the government's assessment of whether or not to support the bid. In response to the decision of the Progress Party, Thorhild Widvey went public with her support of the bid on 15 May 2014. By summer, two other applicant cities (Kraków and Lviv) had withdrawn their bids, leaving Oslo, Beijing and Almaty as the only applicant cities."
"Oslo bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics

== Candidate city phase and rejection of the Olympic organizations' application ==

Oslo, Beijing and Almaty were accepted as Candidate Cities by the IOC on 7 July 2014. The IOC's working group report gave Oslo the highest technical ratings of the three cities. The Norwegian capital led in eight of the 14 categories and was tied with Beijing in three.

With pollings in June 2014 running as low as 29% and 24%, the requirement of 60% support, which Børre Rognlien had previously set, was retracted. During the summer, the bid was able to gain backing from key public figures: the leader of the [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions]], [[Gerd Kristiansen]], as well as the leader of the [[Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise]], [[Kristin Skogen Lund]], both went public with their support of the bid. Oslo 2022 was also supported by the [[Norwegian Young Conservatives]]. However, the youth divisions of the other seven major political parties opposed the bid.

Thorhild Widvey had not informed the public that the reservation towards the Olympic Charter had been withdrawn, but this became known at the beginning of August, causing considerable adverse reactions. On 4 September 2014, in an attempt to drum up support both in public and in parliament, Oslo 2022 presented a cheaper option for hosting the Games, which would reduce the net cost to the public purse from 21.7 billion NOK to 17.4 billion NOK. However, Oslo 2022 were still standing by their original proposal and recommendations.

As an alleged strategic move to establish a ""yes"" vote in the caucus of the Conservative Party, to facilitate the cabinet in supporting the bid, the caucus elected to discuss the bid in early October, prior to the cabinet taking a position. According to several media sources, the parliamentary caucus had a solid majority in favour of the bid at this point. However, in the last couple of days leading up to the deliberation in the Conservative Party, there was a series of negative developments for the bid, including: the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] saying ""no"" through a grass root vote; and an external revision which clarified that the revised cheaper budget was unrealistic. The most damaging development was the public scrutiny of the [[IOC]]'s 7000 pages of requirements. An exposé by the Norwegian tabloid ''[[Verdens Gang]]'' allegedly revealed extravagant hospitality demands made by the IOC. They included a cocktail reception with the [[Norwegian royal family|royal family]] with drinks paid for by them or the organising committee, the provision of road lanes exclusively for use by IOC members, and priority treatment at airports and hotels being used by IOC members. IOC also ""demanded control over all advertising space throughout Oslo"" to be used exclusively by IOC's sponsors, something that is not possible in Norway because Norway is a [[liberal democracy]] where the government doesn't own or control ""all advertising space throughout Oslo"" much of which is privately owned and has no authority to give a foreign private organization exclusive use of an entire city and private property within it. Several commentators pointed out that such demands were unheard of in a western democracy, while ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' described them as being ""diva-like"".

The discussions of the caucus were held in private, after which the parliamentary leader [[Trond Helleland]] explained that the caucus was divided roughly down the middle. The conclusion of the caucus was that this was not an adequate basis for moving forward with the bid, hence their recommendation to the cabinet was to reject the application for a state guarantee and state funding. Various members of the Conservative Party cited lack of public support and enthusiasm, high costs and unreasonable IOC demands as the main reasons for the caucus' negative decision. The conclusion meant that a majority of the members of parliament were now opposed to the bid, leading Oslo 2022 to withdraw its application for state funding and financial guarantee. [[Liberal Party (Norway)]] and [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)]] remained undecided throughout the process."
"Oslo bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics

== Aftermath ==

Immediately following the bid withdrawal, IOC released a statement on Oslo 2022 calling it a ""missed opportunity"" for Norway. The statement also included strong criticism of the bid leadership and government, claiming that ""neither a senior member of the bid team nor a government official"" attended a meeting held by IOC to clarify important issues concerning the games. IOC claimed ""senior politicians in Norway appear not to have been properly briefed on the process and were left to take their decisions on the basis of half-truths and factual inaccuracies"". Bid chair Stian Berger Røsland rejected these claims, calling IOC ""arrogant"". Thorhild Widvey dubbed the IOC claims as ""very sensational"", stating that the IOCs claims were not genuine. ""We have not been invited to a meeting"", Widvey added. Conservative MP [[Svein Harberg]], a prominent supporter of the bid, commented the attack from IOC stating ""I was quite shocked about this at first (...) I was angry when I looked at it. But now I realize that it just shows we made the right decision.""

The Oslo City Council was presented with an evaluation of the bid process December 2014. CEO of Oslo 2022, Eli Grimsby, presented the evaluation with the main conclusion that the distance between the spirit of the Norwegian people and the Olympic movement was too large. Grimsby further stated that the major challenges were in connection with the Host City Contract, which she labelled unbalanced, and as putting too much a burden on the host city. The Norwegian Confederation of Sports also initiated an evaluation on its own. The results were presented 25 March 2015. The evaluation concluded among other things that the bid suffered from poor communication, bad organization, and lack of support on the grass root level of the sporting confederation.

The DOSB also criticized the withdrawal of candidacy with the following statement:

""We regret that Oslo is no longer eligible for the 2022 Winter Olympics. The city, with its great winter sports tradition, had what we think was a convincing and sustainable concept. With the decision, another excellent candidate for the 2022 Winter Olympics will be lost. Now we are relying on the reform process within the framework of the Olympic Agenda 2020.""<ref>{{Cite web|title = OSLO ZIEHT OLYMPIA-BEWERBUNG FÜR 2022 ZURÜCK|url = https://www.dosb.de/sonderseiten/news/news-detail/news/oslo-zieht-olympia-bewerbung-fuer-2022-zurueck|access-date = 2021-10-23}}

"Oslo bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics

== Technical details of the bid ==

=== Financial details ===

In the application for state funding and financial guarantee, Oslo 2022 calculated gross total costs at 33,7 billion NOK. The external quality control review increased the estimate to up to 35,1 billion NOK with 50% certainty, and up to 41,0 billion NOK with 85% certainty. In addition, a study at [[Saïd Business School]] showed that the Olympics had a 100 percent consistency of cost overruns in the period 1960–2012, with the average cost overrun in real terms at 179%. In the period 1999–2012, the average cost overrun is lower, in real terms at 47%.

The 21,7 billion net cost was based on 7 700 million NOK in income, and a total of 29 360 million NOK in public expenditure. The public expenditure included an organizational budget for the organizational committee of 17 510 million NOK, of which 2 800 million NOK was costs of renting the olympic village, media center and media village. 5 070 million NOK were budgeted spent on construction investment. 2 050 million NOK were budgeted in non-organization committee operational costs. 1 330 million NOK were budgeted to cover wage increases, while 3 420 million NOK were set aside to cover uncertainty of cost overruns.<ref name="":2"" />

DNV GL also conducted a socio-economical assessment, concluding that for the economy overall the games overall led to a negative net result of 15 890 million NOK in monetary terms. Of the positive non-monetary effects, enjoyable events and the predicted nationwide enthusiasm was considered the most significant. This included mainly sporting venues (1 100 million NOK), infrastructure improvement (510 million NOK) and investment in security equipment (660 million NOK). Aside from the legacy, the difference between the public net cost of 21,7 billion NOK and the overall negative net result of 15,89 billion NOK consisted mainly of [[Discounted cash flow|discounting]] the future cost to present value (3 930 million NOK) and positive effects for the tourism industry valued at 1 780 million NOK. In the socio-economical assessment, the quality control review removed an alleged 4,9 billion NOK in positive effects of improved health in the population, finding no basis for the claim that hosting the olympics increases physical activity in the population.<ref name="":2"" />"
"Oslo bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics

== Technical details of the bid ==

=== Venues ===

The Oslo 2022 proposal included existing venues around Oslo itself, with a goal of hosting as many events as possible, including snow events, within Oslo's city limits. Certain Alpine events would be held in [[Lillehammer]], which had hosted the 1994 Winter Olympics. Several new venues would also be constructed, and [[Valle Hovin]] would be renovated into an indoor arena. The following is the list of proposed venues for both the ""Oslo Zone"" and ""Lillehammer Zone"".
;Oslo Area
* Wyllerløypa – snowboarding
* [[Grefsenåsen|Grefsenkollen]] – freestyle, snowboarding
* New arena in Stubberud – ice hockey
* [[Jordal Amfi]] – ice hockey
* [[Valle Hovin]] (renovated) – speed skating
* New arena in [[Lørenskog]] – curling
* [[Telenor Arena]] – figure skating and short track
* [[Holmenkollen]] – Nordic skiing
* Grønmo/Huken – biathlon

;Lillehammer Area
* [[Kvitfjell]] – alpine skiing
* [[Hafjell]] – alpine skiing
* [[Hunderfossen]] – bobsleigh, luge, skeleton"
"Oslo bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics

== Technical details of the bid ==

=== Accommodation ===

IOC requires 23,300 beds for accredited people (such as participants, leaders, journalists). This requirement is a little more than the hotel overall capacity of Oslo, Lillehammer and their surrounding areas. Since spectators and other Olympic-related visitors would have to be accommodated, more rooms would be needed. As a result, there were plans to arrange for there to be at least 3,000 additional temporary beds for visitors."
"Oslo bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics

== Technical details of the bid ==

=== Transport ===

Olympic visitors would arrive at [[Oslo Airport]], which receives intercontinental flights. Road and rail connections to all venues in the Lillehammer area would be provided, including a four-lane [[motorway]] between Oslo and Lillehammer ([[European route E06|route E6]])."

==Alpine skiing==

{{main article|Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification}}
The United States qualified a team of six men and 12 women.

The most decorated skier on the U.S. side was [[Mikaela Shiffrin]], who was favored to win gold in several of the six events she was planning to compete in (especially slalom and giant slalom). However, she uncharacteristically crashed out of those races and then finished ninth in the super-G. In the remaining events, Shiffrin did not win a medal.

[[Nina O'Brien]] badly fractured her leg and was hospitalized. Top U.S. downhiller [[Breezy Johnson]] also qualified for the team, but had to withdraw due to a knee injury sustained in January.

{{main article|Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification}}
In the [[2021 World Figure Skating Championships]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, the United States secured two quotas in the men's, ladies', and pairs competitions, and three quotas in the ice dance competition. Third quotas for men's and ladies' were secured at the [[2021 CS Nebelhorn Trophy]].

[[Vincent Zhou]] withdrew from the men's singles event due to a positive COVID-19 test.

The U.S. won silver medals in the [[Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Team event|team event]], which were not awarded at the Olympics due to pending investigation into a Russian doping scandal involving gold medalist [[Kamila Valieva]]. The investigation was still ongoing as of 2023, with the final decision announced in early 2024. The [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) disqualified Valieva and recommended the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) to upgrade the U.S. team to gold, which it did, bringing the country's gold medal tally to nine.

==Calls for Olympic boycott==

{{Further|Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Persecution of Uyghurs in China}}
On 22 February 2021, [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[John Katko]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] called for a United States boycott of the 2022 Olympic Games, citing [[Human rights in China|human rights concerns]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s actions against the country's own Uyghur population, including displacement and imprisonment of civilians in the [[Xinjiang internment camps]]. Representative Katko published an [[open letter]] recommending a boycott to the [[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|House Committee on Homeland Security]], as well as [[Joe Biden|President Biden]], [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Jake Sullivan]], [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Antony Blinken]], [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] [[Alejandro Mayorkas]], and the [[International Olympic Committee]]. In the open letter, Katko cited an earlier 19 January 2021 statement from then-serving U.S. Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]], in which Pompeo stated that, ""since at least March 2017, the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]], under the direction and control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), has committed [[crimes against humanity]] against the predominantly [[Muslims|Muslim]] [[Uyghurs]] and other members of ethnic and religious minority groups in [[Xinjiang]].""

Former [[List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Nations|United States Ambassador to the United Nations]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Nikki Haley]], announced her support of a possible boycott, authoring a 25 February 2021 op-ed for [[Fox News]] titled ""Amb. Nikki Haley: Biden should boycott China's Winter Olympics next year"", comparing the government and ideology of [[Nazi Germany]] to that of ""Communist China"", urging President Biden to boycott the Olympics in collaboration with American-allied nations. Haley further compared the future 2022 Beijing Games to the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Olympics]], the last Olympics to be held before the outbreak of [[World War II]].

In an unrelated interview on 5 March 2021, former Secretary Pompeo stated that the United States should withdraw from the 2022 Olympic Games. In an interview with [[conservative talk radio]] host [[Hugh Hewitt]], Pompeo cited ""nasty activity"" by the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] as evidence to support a boycott.

In a ''[[Politico]]'' article published on 10 March 2021, [[Texas]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Ted Cruz]] spoke against a possible boycott, stating, ""I don't think we should be punishing athletes who have spent their entire lives training. We should go to Beijing, compete, and win."" Florida Senator [[Marco Rubio]] previously signed a resolution authored by Senator [[Rick Scott]] which ""demanded the International Olympic Committee move the 2022 Winter Olympics out of Communist China"", but also refused to support a boycott, stating that he did not make a formal decision yet. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Ben Cardin]], a [[ranking member]] of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], stated that ""It's important that we use every opportunity to advance global support against what China is doing"", recognizing that ""[boycotting the 2022 Olympics] may be not a realistic path forward, but it's certainly something we should be talking about.""

On 15 March 2021, the ''New York Times'' published an op-ed by U.S. Senator and former [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 Republican presidential candidate]], [[Mitt Romney]], titled ""The Right Way to Boycott the Beijing Olympics."" In the piece, Romney stated that the United States should pursue a partial ""[[Economic warfare|economic]] and [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] boycott"" of the Olympics, with athletes participating in the games but ""limiting spectators, selectively shaping our respective delegations and refraining from broadcasting [[Propaganda in China|Chinese propaganda]]."" Romney ended the piece criticizing the International Olympic Committee for their selection of host countries, commenting that ""In [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian states]], the Olympics has more often been a tool of [[propaganda]] than a lever of reform.""

On 19 October 2021, American figure skater [[Evan Bates]] described the situation in Xinjiang as ""terrible"" and ""awful"", and [[Vincent Zhou]] and [[Nathan Chen]], skaters of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent, echoed Bates' statement over the human rights situation in Xinjiang.

On 6 December 2021, President Biden announced that the United States would diplomatically boycott the Olympic Games. Unlike a complete boycott, it did not have any impact for any athletes from the United States attending the Winter Games.

A boycott of the 2022 Olympic Games would have been the second American-led boycott of the modern Olympic Games. The United States and 65 other nations [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycotted]] the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], which were primarily held in [[Moscow]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], [[Soviet Union]], in present-day [[Russia]]. The bloc cited the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan]] as their rationale for the boycott, with the United States hosting a substitute [[track and field]] event called the [[Liberty Bell Classic]], with China in attendance. Four years later, the Soviet Union and 14 of its allies then [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|boycotted]] the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], which were held in [[Los Angeles]], United States. The Soviet-allied countries then substituted the 1984 Olympics by organizing the [[Friendship Games]] (which was attended by China). The Friendship Games were held in a variety of venues, including the Soviet Union, [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (now the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]), [[Cuba]], [[Hungary]], [[Mongolia]], [[Poland]], and [[East Germany]] (now part of [[Germany]]). Despite participating in the Friendship Games, China also [[China at the 1984 Summer Olympics|participated at the 1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles, participating for the first time since [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]] and having boycotted the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow due to the [[Sino-Soviet split]]."

==Athlete safety==

Competitors were warned by [[Human Rights Watch]] that speaking out was not tolerated in China and as a result if they spoke out about human rights or other issues in China they faced significant legal penalties. For their protection the American team was shielded from questions related to human rights.

Members of Congress expressed their concerns about athlete safety.  Retired Olympic cross-country skier [[Noah Hoffman]] also expressed concerns about athlete safety, citing China's human rights record and a lack of concern shown by the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]]."

'''Stockholm 2022''' was a bid by [[Stockholm]] with [[Åre]] and the [[Swedish Olympic Committee]] for the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]. The bid was announced at November 11, 2013. The [[IOC]] will select the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics at the [[127th IOC Session|127th]] [[IOC Session]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]] on July 31, 2015.

On 17 January 2014, the [[Moderate Party]] in Stockholm decided not to support the bid, and after that there is a clear majority in the city council against organising the games.

On 17 January 2014, Stockholm dropped a bid for 2022 Winter Olympics."

In summer 2013, the [[Swedish Olympic Committee]] (SOK) has expressed plans to submit an application for the 2022 Winter Olympics and the 2022 Winter Paralympics in the capital Stockholm. Four [[alpine skiing]] events will be held in Åre in northern Sweden. SOK has the support of the [[Swedish Sports Organization for the Disabled and Swedish Paralympic Committee]] and the [[Swedish Sports Confederation]]. Some people has expressed that the distance between Stockholm and Åre is too far, about {{convert|610|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Åre has three times before applied for the games together with nearby city of [[Östersund]], but have been turned down all times. Östersund was also interested in a potential 2022 bid, but the Swedish Olympic Committee decided not to move forward with bidding due to a lack of financial guarantees from the government. Östersund is probably also too small to host the Olympic Games. [[Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth]], Minister for Culture and Sports, has said that she finds it difficult to see a future Olympic games in Sweden. The president of the Swedish Olympic Committee Stefan Lindeberg thinks that Stockholm's size is perfect for the Winter Olympics and says the city already has the most of what is needed. According to calculations, a Swedish Olympic Games will costs approximately 15–20 billion [[Swedish krona|SEK]] ([[Euro|€]] 1.7–2.3 billion).

On October 1, 2013, investigator Jöran Hägglund indicated that it is entirely possible to host the Winter Olympics in Stockholm. Hägglund estimated the implementation budget to 9.79 billion SEK (€ 1.13 billion) and the investment budget to 2.5 billion SEK (€ 290 million). The games will be concentrated entirely in the Stockholm area, and only eight of the alpine events are planned to be held in Åre. He also said that five investments are necessary; a new track to bobsleigh, luge and skeleton, improve the vertical drop fairly much in [[:sv:Flottsbro|Flottsbrobacken]], a new ski jump, speed skating venue and a cross country venue. The infrastructure and other ice venues already exists in Stockholm. The reason for this cost cut is that the Swedish government does not want to support the games with big money (several 100 million euros). However the IOC requires the government to guarantee support for cost overruns etc. A more thorough investigation showed that the cost estimation was uncertain. IOC requirements would demand reconstruction of several existing arenas, adding VIP lounges for IOC members and separate ones for media, restaurant kitchens etc."

Stockholm is served by the [[Stockholm-Arlanda Airport]], which has intercontinental flights. The distance between Stockholm and Åre is about {{convert|610|km|mi|abbr=on}}. There will be air connections to [[Åre Östersund Airport]] around 90&nbsp;km from Åre. There are suggestions to use an airfield at [[Järpen]] ({{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Åre), which probably must be upgraded to be used for commercial passenger flights. Groups in large planes going to Åre will probably use the [[Trondheim Airport]] in Norway ({{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Åre). There are train connections between Stockholm and Åre, needing around 6 hours."

The '''National Ski Jumping Centre''' ({{zh|s=国家跳台滑雪中心|p=Guójiā Tiàotái Huáxuě Zhōngxīn}}), nicknamed '''Snow Ruyi''' ({{zh|s=雪如意|p=Xuě Rúyì}}), is a Chinese [[ski jumping hill]] in [[Chongli District]], [[Zhangjiakou]], [[Hebei|Hebei Province]], China, opened in 2021.

It is located {{convert|180|km}} northwest from [[Beijing]] and hosted the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] in [[Ski jumping at the 2022 Winter Olympics|ski jumping]] and [[Nordic combined at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Nordic combined]]. After the Olympics, the facilities shall serve as a national training centre, potentially also including junior hills to be built. Hill was designed by Zhiang Li, and got its widely known name after ""[[Ruyi (scepter)|Ruyi]]"", a traditional Chinese ornament symbolizing good luck.

Beside summer ski jumping on plastic, the flat finish (jump out) area of the hill stadium, with grandstand capacity for 6,000 people, will be also used as a [[association football|football]] (soccer) pitch in the summer."

==History==

In 2017, construction started and was planned to be completed in 2019. But due to the unconventional location in between two hills, the elaborate works were done in November 2020.

The Olympic ski jumping stadium was then inaugurated with a celebration on 21 December 2020. One month later, on 19 January 2021, [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|CCP general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] visited the Olympic sports facilities.

Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], all international test events, including World Cup and Continental Cup, in the 2020–21 season had to be cancelled. Premiere jumps were hosted at [[2021–22 FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup|Continental Cup]] in December 2021.

German ski jumper [[David Siegel (ski jumper)|David Siegel]], also a hill record holder at {{convert|141|m}}, won the premiere event on large hill at Continental Cup.

On 5 February 2022, Slovenian female ski jumper [[Urša Bogataj]], became the first olympic champion with gold at new [[Ski jumping at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Women's normal hill individual|normal hill]] (HS106) and also set hill record at 108 metres (354&nbsp;ft) in the first round.

On 6 February 2022, Japan ski jumper [[Ryōyū Kobayashi]] became the Olympic champion at [[Ski jumping at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's normal hill individual|men's normal hill]] (HS106) event. [[Danil Sadreev]] from Russia set hil record in 1st round at 107.5 metres (353&nbsp;ft).

On 7 February 2022, Slovenian national team ([[Nika Križnar]], [[Timi Zajc]], [[Urša Bogataj]] and [[Peter Prevc]]) won historic first ever ski jumping [[Ski jumping at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Mixed team|mixed team]] event in Olympics history with the outstanding record advantage of 111.2 points in front of the runner-up Russia. Third place took Canada, a totally unexpected result. Four women's disqualifications due to the irregular dress equipment in teams of Japan, Austria, Germany and Norway, did change the course of the event, especially for the podiums, but did not in any way influenced in a battle for gold, where Slovenia firmly held strong lead from the beginning of the competition.

Due to controversy of four disqualifications at the ski jumping mixed team event and complaints of several national teams, Agnieszka Aga Baczkowska who is responsible for equipment control, told the media what was actually happening behind the scenes. She explained that some of the four disqualified female had the dresses even up to 10 cm too big according to the FIS rules, it was obvious even on the eye.

On 9 February 2022, German [[Vinzenz Geiger]] won gold medal at Nordic combined [[Nordic combined at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Individual normal hill/10 km|Individual normal hill/10 km]] (HS 106) event. Japanese [[Ryōta Yamamoto]] tied absolute hill record at 108 metres (354&nbsp;ft).

On 12 February 2022, [[Marius Lindvik]] became the Olympic champion at [[Ski jumping at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's large hill individual|men's large hill]] (HS140) event. [[Ryōyū Kobayashi]] was leading after 1st run, where he set absolute hill record at 142 metres (466&nbsp;ft).

On 14 February 2022, German [[Vinzenz Geiger]] set the absolute hill record at 142.5 metres (468&nbsp;ft) on Nordic combined training. Austria won gold medal at [[Ski jumping at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's large hill team|Men's large hill team (HS 140)]] event later that day."

The [[Taiwan|Republic of China]], commonly known as ""Taiwan"", competed as [[Chinese Taipei]] at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], China from 4 to 20 February 2022. Because of the [[political status of Taiwan]] and the [[One-China policy]], the ROC national symbols will not be used as stipulated in the [[Nagoya Resolution]] in 1979 forcing the ROC athletes to compete under the Chinese Taipei moniker since 1984.

[[Huang Yu-ting]] and [[Ho Ping-jui]] were the country's flagbearers during the [[2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]]. Meanwhile alpine skier [[Lee Wen-yi]] was the flagbearer during the [[2022 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]]."
"Chinese Taipei at the 2022 Winter Olympics

==Background==

Since the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the [[Kuomintang]]-ruled [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] has retained control of only [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]], formerly a [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing prefecture]] that was previously under [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial rule]] from 1895 to 1945, and a few other minor islands.  When international recognition shifted to the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s [[People's Republic of China]] in the 1970s and under the PRC's [[One-China policy|One-China principle]], the only way the ROC could participate in international organizations was under a name acceptable to the PRC.  Nevertheless, the ROC was allowed to compete under that name at the [[1972 Winter Olympics]] and the [[1976 Winter Olympics]].

The ROC boycotted the Olympics in 1976 and 1980 after not being allowed to compete under the name ""Republic of China"". Chinese Taipei has sent delegations to every Winter Olympic Games since, making Turin their seventh appearance at a Winter Olympics. Their delegation to Turin consisted of a single competitor in luge, Ma Chih-hung. He was accompanied to Turin by coaches and teammates to act as logistical support.  Ma was the flag bearer for the [[2006 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] while a volunteer carried the flag for the [[2006 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]].

The Chinese Taipei team announced in January 2022 that its athletes would not partake in the opening or closing ceremonies, citing [[COVID-19 pandemic]] measures and delayed flights. The decision was reached as a PRC official wrongly labelled the ROC as ""Taipei, China"". After the [[International Olympic Committee]] issued a statement confirming that all teams must send personnel to participate in the opening and closing ceremonies, the [[Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee]] declared that the ROC would attend both ceremonies. In turn, the [[Taiwan Association for Human Rights]] and other organizations protested the CTOC's decision to attend the ceremony, opining that the ROC's attendance was an endorsement of PRC's poor human rights record."

The following is about the qualification rules and the quota allocation for the [[Biathlon at the 2022 Winter Olympics|biathlon]] at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]."
"Biathlon at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Quota allocation==

A total quota of 210 athletes are allowed at the Games (105 both men and women). The first 93 quota allocations, per gender, will be assigned using a combination of the Nation Cup scores of their top 3 athletes in their best six sprints, one individual, three relays, one mixed relay, and one single mixed relay.  These results will come during the [[2020–21 Biathlon World Cup]] and [[2021–22 Biathlon World Cup]]s seasons, up until 16 January 2022. The final 12 spots, per gender, will be allocated using the IBU Qualifying Points List, to nations who have not qualified any athletes yet, with a maximum of two per nation.

On 16 January 2022, NOCs ranked 1-3 will qualify six athletes, 4-10 five athletes, and 11-20 four athletes, for both male and female competitions.  The final twelve spots in each gender are filled individually from the IBU Qualifying points list to a maximum of two for a nation, from nations not already qualified.  Two of these spots will be used by the host if not already qualified.  The host may only start in the relay competitions that they have enough qualified athletes for.  Reallocation of unused quotas will be from the IBU Qualifying points list for nations that have not yet qualified, or only have one qualifier.  For each event a maximum of 4 athletes per NOC may compete, except the Mass Start in which it remains possible to qualify up to 6."
"Biathlon at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Quota allocation==

===Minimum Requirements===

During the [[2020–21 Biathlon World Cup|2020/21]] or [[2021–22 Biathlon World Cup|2021/22]] Biathlon World Cup season the athlete must have two results at IBU Cup, Open European Championships, World Championships or World Cup in the Sprint or Individual and have at most an IBU Qualifying point total of 150 or less. Or, two placings in the top half at the Junior World Championships. They also can have a combination of both criteria (one of each). All relay members must meet this requirement as well."

'''Almaty 2022''' ({{langx|kk|Алматы 2022}}) was an unsuccessful bid for the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] by the city of [[Almaty]] and the National Olympic Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The [[IOC]] selected the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics at the [[128th IOC Session|128th]] [[IOC Session]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]] on July 31, 2015, in which [[Beijing]] won. Under the slogan “Keeping it Real,” Almaty had emphasized their traditional winter setting with tall mountains and plenty of natural snow coverage as well as compactness — most venues are within half an hour’s travel through Alpine scenery.
Almaty was the only contender to have never hosted the Olympics before. Almaty previously hosted the [[2017 Winter Universiade]]."

On 29 November 2011, Almaty was chosen to host the [[2017 Winter Universiade]]. The city also co-hosted the [[2011 Asian Winter Games]] with the capital, [[Astana]]. It can be seen as preparation for hosting the Winter Olympic Games in the future.

Kazakhstan had been considering a bid for these games since 2011. On 17 August 2013, [[Almaty]], the former [[capital city]] and still the largest city and financial centre of the country, confirmed their bid for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. They were the first city to do so."

===Olympic Rings Reveal===

The Olympic Rings performance began with the giant LED screens showing a drop of ink that had fallen from the sky, turning into seething, rolling waves of the [[Yellow River]], from which an ice cube crystallizes. 24 ""laser beams"" sequentially ""carve"" the names of cities and countries of [[Winter Olympic Games#List of Winter Olympic Games|23 previous Winter Olympics]] in Chinese and English on this cube. The 24th was shown when the rays merged into a single beam, which ""cut out"" ""2022 BEIJING CHINA"". Six hockey players then entered the stadium and swung at a massive LED hockey puck. It flew into the cube, slowly fracturing it as the five ice [[Olympic symbols#Olympic rings|Olympic rings]] rose from inside.

===Parade of nations===

{{main|2022 Winter Olympics Parade of Nations}}
Following the formation of the ice Olympic Rings, greetings appeared in the stadium in many languages of the world. Per tradition, the national team of [[Greece at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Greece]], the country of origin of [[Olympics]] marched first. The country that will host the next [[2026 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]], [[Italy at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Italy]], marched before the host nation, China, which entered last. The patriotic song ""[[Ode to the Motherland]]"" was played when [[China at the 2022 Winter Olympics|China]] entered the stadium. Other teams, in the same practice of the opening ceremony of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], entered in a [[collation]] method based on their countries names as written in [[Simplified Chinese characters]] and is similar to [[Chinese characters#Indexing|that used in Chinese dictionaries]]. The names were sorted by the number of [[Stroke (CJK character)|stroke]]s in the first character of the name, then by the stroke order of the character (in the [[stroke count method]] order), then the number of strokes and stroke order of the second character, then next character and so on. In front of each country's delegation, a Chinese representative carried a snowflake-shaped sign with the name of the delegation in both English and Chinese. After the parade, all such ""snowflakes"" of the participating delegations formed a large ""snowflake"" to symbolise the world coming together.<ref name=""auto5""/>

==Controversy and concerns==

===Taiwan's participation===

On 26 January 2022, a spokesperson of China's [[Taiwan Affairs Office]] ""incorrectly"" called the [[Chinese Taipei]] (Taiwan) team ""[[Taiwan, China#Taipei, China|Taipei, China]]"". Later that day, Taiwan announced that their Olympic team would not attend the opening and closing ceremonies in Beijing, formally due to anti-COVID-19 rules and delayed flights. The same day, another Taiwan official stated that Taiwan would be diplomatically boycotting the ceremonies as well. On 28 January 2022, a Taiwan official also stated concern that the Chinese Taipei (中华台北) and Hong Kong, China (中国香港) delegations would be adjacent to each other in the Parade of Nations due to the [[2022 Winter Olympics Parade of Nations#Parade order|Chinese collation order]], ""downgrading"" Taiwan's status.

Between 29 January and 31 January 2022, the International Olympic Committee repeatedly contacted the [[Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee]], stating that it was obligated to attend the ceremonies to ""comply with the Olympic Charter"". (The IOC had already suspended [[North Korea at the Olympics#History|North Korea]] for not sending a team to the [[2020 Summer Olympics|Tokyo Summer Games]] in violation of the Olympic Charter.) On 1 February 2022, Taiwanese officials relented on their boycott. According to attendees of the rehearsal of the opening ceremony, Japan and Chinese Taipei marched adjacently, followed by ""a few"" countries, followed by Hong Kong, preventing the Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong delegations from being adjacent. However, during the actual opening ceremony, Japan, Chinese Taipei, and Hong Kong marched adjacently in that order.

On China's state media, the broadcast of the opening ceremony cut away to a clip of Xi Jinping when the Chinese Taipei delegation paraded, while the broadcast's commentator announced the delegation's name as ""Taipei, China""."
"2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony

==Controversy and concerns==

===Ratings on NBC network===

Groups critical of China's human rights record urged viewers to boycott the 2022 Games on television. In the United States, [[NBC]]'s live broadcast of the ceremony was the lowest watched opening ceremony in U.S. history. TV coverage of the 2022 Games overall has continued to trend down in ratings since Pyeongchang 2018 and the [[2020 Summer Olympics|Tokyo Games]] just six months prior, while streaming continued to see massive increases."
"2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony

==Controversy and concerns==

===Hanbok controversy===

Some South Korean people were angered and accused China of appropriating Korean culture as their own, as one of the performers representing the [[Koreans in China|ethnic Koreans in China]] wore a traditional [[hanbok|choson-ot]] when delivering the national flag of China. Democratic Party presidential nominee [[Lee Jae-myung]], People Power Party presidential nominee [[Yoon Suk-yeol]], People's Party presidential candidate [[Ahn Cheol-soo]] joined the fray and expressed their discontent. However some South Koreans felt their politicians' reactions were misguided, and say that it was clear to them, that the woman was representing the estimated 2 million ethnic Koreans who live in China. The Chinese Embassy in South Korea responded that China respected the historical and cultural traditions of South Korea, and hanbok belongs to ethnic Koreans everywhere, including in China."

[[File:Russian sportspeople at the Opening ceremony of the XXIV Winter Olympic Games.jpg|300px|thumb|Russian athletes at the Opening ceremony of the XXIV Winter Olympic Games]]
Russian athletes competed at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], China, from 4 to 20 February 2022, under the ""'''[[Russian Olympic Committee]]'''"" designation (using the acronym ""'''ROC'''"") due to the consequences of the [[Doping in Russia|doping scandal]] in the country. 

On 9 December 2019, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for four years, after it had been found that data provided by the [[Russian Anti-Doping Agency]] had been manipulated by Russian authorities with a goal of protecting athletes involved in its [[Doping in Russia|state-sponsored doping scheme]]. Russia later filed an appeal to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) against the WADA decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport, on review of Russia's appeal of its case from WADA, ruled on 17 December 2020 to reduce the penalty that WADA had placed. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as ""Neutral Athlete"" or ""Neutral Team"". The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display ""Russia"" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the ""Neutral Athlete/Team"" designation. Russia could appeal the decision.<ref name="":0"" />

On 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym ""ROC"", after the name of the [[Russian Olympic Committee]]. On aftermatch, the IOC announced that the Russian national flag would be substituted by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee. It would also be allowed to use team uniforms bearing the words ""Russian Olympic Committee"", or the acronym ""ROC"" would be added.

On 15 April 2021, the uniforms for the Russian Olympic Committee athletes were unveiled, featuring the colours of the Russian flag. On 22 April 2021, the replacement for Russia's anthem was approved by the IOC, after an earlier choice of the patriotic Russian song ""[[Katyusha (song)|Katyusha]]"" was rejected. A fragment of [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|Piano Concerto No.&nbsp;1]] is used.

Triple gold medalist and eight-time medalist [[Alexander Bolshunov]] was the closing ceremony flagbearer.

On 19 February, Russian athletes officially set a new record for the total number of medals won, having earned at least 32 and improving on [[Russia at the 2014 Winter Olympics|Russia's previous best result in Sochi]] (30 medals) and [[Soviet Union at the 1988 Winter Olympics|USSR's result in Calgary]] (29 medals). However, in the gold medal count the team finished only ninth with five gold medals.{{efn|name=Valieva|On 29 January 2024, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) disqualified [[Kamila Valieva]] for four years retroactive to 25 December 2021 for an anti-doping rule violation. On 30 January 2024, the ISU reallocated medals, upgrading the United States to gold and Japan to silver while downgrading the ROC to bronze. As such, Russia's totals changed from six gold medals and 14 bronze medals to five gold medals and 15 bronze medals.}}"

The '''2020–21 figure skating season''' began on July 1, 2020, and ended on June 30, 2021. During this season, elite skaters competed at the [[2021 World Figure Skating Championships|2021 World Championships]], as well as at elite events such as the [[2020–21 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix series]] and the [[2020–21 ISU Challenger Series|Challenger Series]].

Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) cancelled the [[2020–21 ISU Junior Grand Prix|Junior Grand Prix series]] and the [[2020–21 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]].<ref name=ISU200720/><ref name=ISU-201210/> Additionally, the 2021 [[2021 European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships]], [[2021 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|Four Continents Championships]], and [[2021 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior Championships]] were all cancelled, although the [[2021 World Figure Skating Championships|2021 World Championships]] were still held.<ref name=ISU-201210/><ref name=ISU-201016/><ref name=ISU-201124/>"
"2020–21 figure skating season

== Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic ==

On May 1, 2020, the [[International Skating Union]] established a working group, chaired by ISU Vice-president for Figure Skating Alexander Lakernik, to monitor the ongoing [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. Its responsibilities included determining the feasibility of holding events as scheduled, possibly behind closed doors, during the first half of the season, and the financial impact of any potential cancellations. On August 31, the ISU published the official [https://isu.org/docman-documents-links/isu-files/documents-communications/clean-sport-1/coronavirus/24905-isu-guidelines-covid-19-pandemic-sport-specific-annex-figure-skating-final-20-08-31/file Guidelines for ISU Events During the COVID-19 Pandemic].

On July 9, the [[General Administration of Sport of China]] announced that no international sporting events would be held in China in 2020 except for [[2022 Winter Olympics]] test events. The [[Chinese Skating Association]] was scheduled to host several events during the season, including the [[Cup of China]], the Grand Prix Final, and the [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior Championships]]. While the Grand Prix Final, scheduled to be hosted in [[Beijing]], was exempt from the Chinese government's ruling due to its status as the test event for the Olympic Games, the ISU had not yet discussed a contingency plan regarding Grand Prix event cancellations at the time of the Chinese government's announcement. The ISU announced on July 13 that the Cup of China would remain as scheduled in [[Chongqing]] due to its connection to the Beijing test event: the Grand Prix Final.

On July 20, the ISU officially cancelled the Junior Grand Prix series, citing increased travel and entry requirements between countries and potentially excessive sanitary & health care costs for hosting members. Over half of the events of the [[2020–21 ISU Challenger Series]] were also either cancelled by the host federations or postponed to an unspecified later date. 

On August 4, the ISU confirmed that the Grand Prix series would proceed as scheduled during the fall, with a decision to be made regarding the Grand Prix Final at a later date. The competitions were expected to feature skaters from the home country, skaters already training in the host nation, and skaters assigned to that event for geographic reasons; all officials would also be from the national organizing committee. On September 25, [[U.S. Figure Skating]] announced that [[Skate America]] would be held without an audience in line with [[Nevada Gaming Control Board]] guidelines regarding the pandemic. On September 30, the ISU announced that the Grand Prix Final would not be held as scheduled in Beijing on December 10–13, and that they were searching for an alternate host outside China for the event. On October 14, [[Skate Canada]] announced the cancellation of the 2020 Skate Canada International due to the worsening situation in Ontario. The [[French Federation of Ice Sports]] informed the ISU of the cancellation of the 2020 Internationaux de France on October 19. In November, the Grand Prix Final was first removed from China altogether, before being definitively cancelled on December 10, 2020. The ISU later rescheduled the Beijing test event to the 2021 [[Asian Open Figure Skating Trophy]] in October.

On October 16, the ISU announced the cancellation of the [[2021 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2021 Four Continents Championships]]. The [[2021 World Figure Skating Championships|2021 World Championships]] were held as scheduled in [[Stockholm, Sweden]], on March 22–28, although three positive [[COVID-19]] cases were detected during the event. In addition, the ISU slightly modified the qualification rules to allow additional skaters the opportunity to meet the minimum TES requirements.

Due to the vast difference in skaters' travel restrictions, the ISU determined that it would be unfair to award [[ISU World Standings and Season's World Ranking|ISU world standings and season's world ranking]] points at the [[2020–21 ISU Challenger Series|Challenger Series]] and [[2020–21 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] events. Thus, the 2021 World Championships were the only event to affect the [[2020–21 ISU World Standings and Season's World Ranking|2020–21 ISU world standings]]. As the Junior Grand Prix and World Junior Championships were cancelled, junior skaters had no opportunities to earn World Standing Points for the season.

Scores earned at the domestic Grand Prix events did not count as official ISU scores for the purposes of achieving minimum TES requirements or as personal/season's bests.<ref name=ISU-GPFAQ/> Thus, the season's best scores list was composed entirely of scores earned on the Challenger Series, where the [[2020 CS Nebelhorn Trophy|2020 Nebelhorn Trophy]] and [[2020 CS Budapest Trophy|2020 Budapest Trophy]] were the only two of ten scheduled events to be held, the 2021 World Championships, and the [[2021 ISU World Team Trophy in Figure Skating|2021 World Team Trophy]]."

{{2022 Winter Olympics}}
The '''2022 Winter Olympics''', officially called the '''XXIV Olympic Winter Games''' ({{zh|s=第二十四届冬季奥林匹克运动会|p=Dì Èrshísì Jiè Dōngjì Àolínpǐkè Yùndònghuì}}) and commonly known as '''Beijing 2022''' ({{lang|zh|北京}}2022), were an international winter [[multi-sport event]] held from 4 to 20 February 2022 in [[Beijing]], China, and surrounding areas with competition in selected events beginning 2 February 2022. It was the 24th edition of the [[Winter Olympic Games]].

Beijing was selected as host city on 31 July 2015 at the [[128th IOC Session]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia, marking its second time hosting the Olympics, and the last of three consecutive Olympics hosted in [[East Asia]] following the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in Pyeongchang County, South Korea, and the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo, Japan. Having previously hosted the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], Beijing became the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics. The venues for the Games were concentrated around Beijing, its suburb [[Yanqing District]], and [[Zhangjiakou]], with some events (including the ceremonies and curling) repurposing venues originally built for Beijing 2008 (such as [[Beijing National Stadium]] and the [[Beijing National Aquatics Centre]]).

The Games featured a record 109 events across 15 disciplines, with [[Freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics|big air freestyle skiing]] and [[Bobsleigh at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Women's monobob|women's monobob]] making their Olympic debuts as medal events, as well as several new mixed competitions. A total of 2,871 athletes representing 91 teams competed in the Games, with [[Haiti at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Haiti]] and [[Saudi Arabia at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Saudi Arabia]] making their Winter Olympic debut.

Beijing's hosting of the Games was subject to various [[Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics|concerns and controversies]] including those related to [[Human rights in China|human rights violations in China]], such as the [[persecution of Uyghurs in China]], which led to calls for a boycott of the games. Like the [[2020 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] held six months earlier in Tokyo, the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] resulted in the implementation of health and safety protocols, and, for the second Games in a row, the Games being closed to the public (with selected events open to invited guests at a reduced capacity).

[[Norway at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Norway]] finished at the top of the medal table for the second successive Winter Olympics, winning a total of 37 medals, of which 16 were gold, setting a new record for the largest number of gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics. The host nation [[China at the 2022 Winter Olympics|China]] finished fourth with nine gold medals and also eleventh place by total medals won, marking its most successful performance in Winter Olympics history."

== Bidding process ==

{{Main|Bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics}}
The bidding calendar was announced by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in October 2012, with the application deadline set for 14 November 2013. The IOC Executive Board reviewed the bids from all applicant cities on 7 July 2014 and selected three cities, [[Oslo]] (Norway), [[Almaty]] (Kazakhstan), and [[Beijing]] (China), as the final candidates.

Several [[National Olympic Committee|bid cities]] withdrew their bids during the process, citing the high costs or the lack of local support and funding for hosting the Games. The [[Oslo bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics|Oslo bid]], considered the clear frontrunner, was canceled in the wake of a series of revelations about the IOC's demands for luxury treatment of IOC members that strongly turned public opinion and the parliamentary majority against the bid. The city withdrew its application for government funding after a majority of the [[Norwegian parliament]] had stated their intention to decline the application. In the days before the decision, Norwegian media had revealed the IOC's ""diva-like demands for luxury treatment"" for the IOC members themselves, such as special lanes on all roads only to be used by IOC members and cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family. The IOC also ""demanded control over all advertising space throughout Oslo"" to be used exclusively by IOC's sponsors, something that is not possible in Norway because the government doesn't own or control ""all advertising space throughout Oslo"" and has no authority to give a foreign private organization exclusive use of a city and the private property within it. Several commentators pointed out that such demands were unheard of in a western democracy; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' described the IOC as a ""notoriously ridiculous organization run by grifters and hereditary aristocrats."" Ole Berget, deputy minister in the Finance Ministry, said ""the IOC's arrogance was an argument held high by a lot of people.""

Beijing was selected as the host city of the 2022 Winter Olympics after beating Almaty by four votes on 31 July 2015 at the [[128th IOC Session|128th]] [[IOC Session]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia.

In February 2021, Beijing announced that the 26 venues (including training venues) for these sports would be running on entirely [[renewable energy]].

There were three different clusters of venues designed and constructed for the 2022 Winter Olympics, each respectively known as the Beijing Zone, the Zhangjiakou Zone, and the Yanging Zone."

=== Venues ===

==== Beijing Zone ====

Venues in the Beijing Zone exist in different conditions; some were recently constructed exclusively for the 2022 games, while the rest were renovated from [[2008 Summer Olympics|the 2008 Summer Olympics]] or other existing sites. The Beijing Zone of the 2022 Winter Olympics consisted of six competition venues and was where the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, for both the 2022 Winter Olympics and 2008 Summer Olympics, would take place.<ref name=""auto4""/>

Five ice events were held at the [[Olympic Green]], the [[Capital Indoor Stadium]] and the Beijing [[Wukesong Sports Center]], which had been some of the main venues of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. The Big Air snowboarding and freestyle skiing events were held in a former industrial area in [[Shijingshan District]], at [[Western Hills]] area. Since the end of 2009, the [[Beijing Olympic Village]] apartments on the Olympic Green had been transformed into a residential area. There was therefore a need to build another Olympic Village on a smaller scale for the Winter Olympics. These new buildings are located in the southern area of Olympic Green on the neighbourhood of the [[National Olympic Sports Center]] and will serves as [[Chinese Olympic Committee]] residential complex for those athletes who will undergo training sessions at the nearby venues.

The '''[[Beijing National Stadium]]''' was an iconic venue in the Beijing Zone, and it is also known as the '''Bird's Nest''' (鸟巢; ''Niǎocháo''). The Beijing National Stadium was the site that hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies for the 2022 Winter Olympics, but it was no longer a venue for any competition in 2022.

The '''[[Beijing National Aquatics Centre|National Aquatics Center]] ('''国家游泳中心 Guójiā Yóuyǒng Zhōngxīn /gwor-jyaa yoh-yong jong-sshin/), also known as the '''Water Cube''', was the venue for [[Curling]] competition. In the 2022 Winter Olympics, the National Aquatics Center became the first Olympic venue to incorporate a curling track in the swimming pool.

The '''[[Big Air Shougang|Shougang Big Air]]''' (首钢滑雪大跳台中心 Shǒugāng Huáxuě Dàtiàotái Zhōngxīn /shoh-gung hwaa-sshwair daa-tyao-teye jong-sshin/) was a newly constructed site for the 2022 Winter Olympics. The Shougang Big Air hosted the [[freestyle skiing]] and [[snowboarding]] events.

The [[Wukesong Arena|'''Wukesong Sports Centre''']] (五棵松体育馆 Wǔkēsōng Tǐyùguǎn /woo-ker-song tee-yoo-gwan/) was under an 8-month renovation for the 2022 Winter Olympics. In February 2022, the Wukesong Sports Centre hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics Men's and Women's [[ice hockey]] tournaments.

The [[Beijing National Indoor Stadium|'''National Indoor Stadium''']] (国家体育馆 Guójiā Tǐyùguǎn /gwor-jyaa tee-yoo-gwan/) was the second venue for the [[ice hockey]] tournament for the 2022 Winter Olympics, besides the Wukesong Sports Centre.

The [[Beijing National Speed Skating Oval|'''National Speed Skating Oval''']] (国家速滑馆 Guójiā Sùhuáguǎn /gwor-jyaa soo-hwaa-gwan/) has the nickname ""Ice Ribbon"" due to its exterior design. The National Speed Skating Oval was the venue for [[speed skating]] in the 2022 Winter Olympics.

The '''[[Capital Indoor Stadium]]''' (首都体育馆 Shǒudū Tǐyùguǎn), also known as the Capital Gymnasium, was a venue adapted from the 2008 Summer Olympics and was reconstructed for [[short-track speed skating]] and [[figure skating]] competitions in the 2022 Winter Olympics.

In 2016, it was announced that Chongli received 2.185 million tourists, an increase of 30% from the previous season, during the first snow season after winning the Olympic bid. The snow season lasted for five months from November, during which Chongli has hosted thirty-six competitions and activities, such as Far East Cup and Children Skiing International Festival. A total of twenty-three skiing camps have also been set up, attracting the participation of 3,800 youths. All the venues construction started in November 2016 and was finished by the end of 2020 to enable the city to hold test events.{{Update inline|date=February 2022}}

The design for the Games' medals was unveiled on 26 October 2021. The concept is based on the 2008 Summer Olympics medals and Chinese astronomy and astrology as the games were held coinciding with the [[Chinese New Year]] festivities.

The uniforms for medal presenters at medal ceremonies were unveiled in January 2022. The uniforms have been designed in a joint project by the [[Central Academy of Fine Arts]] and [[Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology]].<ref name=""beijing_2022_reveals_uniforms_for_medal_ceremonies_heavily_influenced_by_snow_2022""/>"

The torch relay started on 18 October 2021 in Greece. On 20 October 2021, it was announced that the local leg would start on 2 February and end on 4 February 2022 during the Opening Ceremonies. The local leg only visited two cities: [[Beijing]] and [[Zhangjiakou]]. Activists staged a protest at the Olympic torch lighting ceremony in Greece.

The inclusion and television appearance of Qi Fabao, a [[People's Liberation Army]] commander well known in China for his involvement in the [[2020–2021 China–India skirmishes]], as one of 1,200 torchbearers have been controversial, with India launching a diplomatic boycott of the Games as a result."

=== Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic ===

{{see also|2020 Summer Olympics#Biosecurity protocols|COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China|Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports}}
[[File:Winter olympic bubble vehicle sign on the rear of a bus (20220201124650).jpg|thumb|Buses serving the Olympic bubble have red stickers on front and rear]]
The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] resulted in changes in the qualifying process for [[Curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification|curling]] and [[Ice hockey at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Women's qualification|women's ice hockey]] due to the [[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports|cancellation of tournaments]] in 2020. Qualification for curling was based on placement in the 2021 World Curling Championships and an [[2021 Olympic Qualification Event – Curling|Olympic Qualification Event]] that completed the field (in place of points earned across the 2020 and 2021 World Curling Championships). The IIHF based its qualification for the women's tournament upon existing [[IIHF World Ranking]]s, without holding the [[2020 IIHF Women's World Championship|2020 Women's World Championship]].

On 29 September 2021, the IOC announced biosecurity protocols for the Games; all athletes were required to remain within the [[bio-secure bubble]] (referred to as a ""closed-loop management system"") for the duration of their participation, which included daily [[COVID-19 testing]], and only being allowed to travel to and from Games-related venues. Unless they are fully-[[COVID-19 vaccine|vaccinated]] or have a valid medical exemption, all athletes were required to quarantine for 21 days upon their arrival. Mirroring a protocol adopted for the 2020 Summer Olympics before they were moved [[Behind closed doors (sport)|behind closed doors]], the IOC also announced that only residents of the People's Republic of China would be permitted to attend the Games as spectators.

On 23 December 2021, the United States' [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and its labor union, the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA), announced that they had agreed to withdraw their players' participation in the Games' men's hockey tournament, citing concerns over COVID-19 and the need to make up games that had been postponed due to COVID-19 outbreak As part of their latest [[collective agreement]] with the NHLPA, the NHL had agreed to accommodate a break for the Olympics and player participation for the first time since 2014.

On 17 January 2022, amid increasing lockdowns across China and the first detected case of the [[Omicron variant]] in Beijing, it was announced that ticket sales to the general public were cancelled, and that limited numbers of spectators would be admitted by invitation only. These, therefore, became the second Olympics in a row that were closed to the general public. In the lead-up to the Games, organizers stated that they had aimed for at least 30% capacity at each venue, divided equally between spectators from within the ""closed loop"" (including dignitaries, delegations, and the press), and invited guests from outside of it (including local residents, school students, winter sports enthusiasts, and marketing partners). At least 150,000 spectators from outside the ""closed loop"" were expected to attend. Spectators were only present at events held in Beijing and Zhangjiakou; all events in Yanqing were held behind closed doors with no spectators permitted.

Everyone present at the Games, including athletes, staff, and attendees, were required to use the My2022 [[mobile app]] as part of the biosecurity protocols, which was used for submissions of [[customs declaration]]s and health records for travel to the Games, daily health self-reporting, and records of COVID-19 vaccination and testing. The app also provided news and information relating to the Games, and [[Messaging app|messaging]] functions. Concerns were raised about the security of the My2022 app and how information collected by it would be used, so several delegations advised their athletes to bring [[burner phone]]s and laptops for the duration of the games.

Because of the strict COVID-19 protocol, some top athletes, considered to be medal contenders, were not able to travel to China after having tested positive, even if asymptomatic. The cases included Austrian ski jumper [[Marita Kramer]], the leader of the World Cup ranking, and Russian skeletonist [[Nikita Tregubov]], silver medalist of the 2018 Winter Olympics."

=== Transportation ===

[[File:Guantingreservoirandbridges.jpg|thumb|[[G6 Beijing–Lhasa Expressway]] and [[Beijing–Zhangjiakou intercity railway]] connect Beijing with Zhangjiakou.]]
[[File:CR400BF-C-5162 at Chengjiayao (20220110145226).jpg|thumb|left|[[China Railway CR400BF|CR400BF-C-5162]] had been converted to a dedicated train for the Winter Olympics.]]
The new [[Beijing–Zhangjiakou intercity railway]] opened in late 2019, starting from [[Beijing North railway station]] and ending at [[Zhangjiakou railway station (Opened in 1957)|Zhangjiakou railway station]]. It was built for speeds of up to {{cvt|350|km/h}}; with this new road system, the travel time from Beijing to Zhangjiakou was decreased to around 50 minutes. A dedicated train for the Winter Olympics began to run on this line in January 2022, featuring a mobile television studio that supports live broadcast on the train.

On 31 December 2021, the [[Beijing Subway]] reached the planned {{cvt|783|km}} at the bid book.

Planned before the city was awarded the rights to the Games, the [[Beijing Daxing International Airport]] opened in 2019, and due to the strategic location, it would be the main focus for the arrival and entry of delegations on Chinese soil. Chinese officials had hoped that this airport would replace Beijing Capital International Airport as the country's main hub for arrivals and departures between its opening and the Winter Games and reduce the international and domestic demands of the older airport. This airport replaced the old [[Beijing Nanyuan Airport]] which was out of date and was on the list of the most dangerous airports in the world because of its location and since its opening, it has been sharing the local and international demands of the city and the country with the older [[Beijing Capital International Airport]]. However, according to the COVID-19 pandemic security protocol manual issued by [[Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|BOCWOG]] and International Olympic Committee, all foreign delegations could only enter and leave Beijing via [[Beijing Capital International Airport|the Capital International Airport]] due to its smaller size and the fact that it is closer to the city center and Olympic Green and has specific isolation areas and a better health protocols."

=== Budget ===

The original estimated budget for the Games was US$3.9 billion, less than one-tenth of the $43 billion spent on the 2008 Summer Olympics. Although there were reports that the games might cost more than US$38.5 billion, the final official budget was US$2.24 billion and turning a profit of $52 million, of which the International Olympic Committee (IOC) donated $10.4 million of that surplus to the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC) to help with the development of sport in China."

The opening ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics was held on 4 February 2022 at [[Beijing National Stadium]].

Amid the political controversies and tensions impacting the Games, IOC president [[Thomas Bach]] instructed athletes to ""show how the world would look like, if we all respect the same rules and each other"", and pledged that ""there [would] be no discrimination for any reason whatsoever.""

The final seven torchbearers reflected multiple decades of Chinese athletes, beginning with the 1950s, and concluding with two skiers competing in the Games—21 year-old skier Zhao Jiawen from [[Shanxi]] (the first Chinese athlete to compete in [[Nordic combined at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Nordic combined]]), and 20-year-old [[Dinigeer Yilamujiang]] from the [[Xinjiang]] autonomous region ([[Cross-country skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics|cross-country]], and the first Chinese cross-country skier to win a medal in an [[International Ski Federation|ISF]] event).

For the first time in Olympic history, the final torchbearers did not light a cauldron: instead, they fitted the torch into the centre of a large stylised [[snowflake]], constructed from placards bearing the names of the delegations competing in the Games.<ref name="":2"" /> Three similar snowflakes were also erected as public flames, with one outside of the stadium lit by a volunteer, one in Yanqing District lit by speed skater [[Yu Jongjun]], and the third in Zhangjiakou lit by skier [[Wang Wezhuo]].<ref name="":1"" />"

=== New events ===

In October 2016, the [[International Ski Federation]] (FIS) announced plans to begin permitting women's competitions in [[Nordic combined]], to contest the discipline at the Olympic level for the first time in Beijing. In November 2017, a further three events were put forward by the FIS for possible Olympic inclusion: a [[ski jumping]] mixed team competition and men's and women's [[big air]] in [[freestyle skiing]]. At their May 2018 [[International Ski Federation#FIS Congress history|Congress]] at the Costa Navarino resort in [[Messenia]], [[Greece]], the FIS submitted several additional events for consideration, including a proposal to make [[telemark skiing]] an Olympic discipline for the first time in Beijing, with proposed competitions to include the men's and women's parallel sprint and a mixed team parallel sprint. The Congress also approved to submit the [[Freestyle Skiing#Aerial skiing|aerials]] mixed team event, and several new [[snowboarding]] events: the men and women's [[snowboard cross]] team event; a mixed team alpine parallel event; the men's and women's parallel special slalom; and a mixed team parallel special slalom event. The individual parallel special slalom events were featured at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], [[Russia]], but were dropped from the Olympic program in [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018]] to make way for the snowboarding [[big air]] competitions.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}

The [[International Luge Federation]] (FIL) proposed the addition of six new events, including [[natural track luge]] (men's and women's singles), a women's doubles competition on the artificial track, and sprint events (men, women, and doubles) on the artificial track.

The [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) continued to campaign for the addition of [[synchronized skating]] as a new event within the discipline of [[Figure skating at the Olympics|figure skating]]. The ISU also proposed a new mixed team event in [[short track speed skating]].

In [[biathlon]], a single mixed relay was proposed by the [[International Biathlon Union]] (IBU) to complement the four-person mixed relay that featured at the 2018 Winter Olympics.<ref name=""itg2018"" /> Also, the [[International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation]] (IBSF) proposed a new team event, but there was no plan to introduce a four-woman bobsleigh event despite the recommendation from the federation's executive board to propose such an event in the interests of gender equality.<ref name=""itg2018"" />

In July 2018, the IOC announced changes to the program for the 2022 Winter Olympics as part of a goal to increase the participation of women, and appeal to younger audiences. Seven new medal events were added (expanding the total program to 109 events), including men's and women's big air freestyle, women's [[monobob]], mixed team competitions in freestyle skiing aerials, ski jumping, and snowboard cross, and the mixed relay in short track speed skating. Women's Nordic combined was not added; Nordic combined remains the only Winter Olympic sport only contested by men."

On 9 December 2019, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with lab data that it provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the [[Russian Anti-Doping Agency]] being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA planned to allow individually cleared [[Russian Olympic Committee athletes at the 2020 Summer Olympics|Russian athletes]] to take part in the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] under a neutral banner, as instigated at the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], but they were not permitted to compete in team sports. WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use ""[[Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics|Olympic Athletes from Russia]]"" (OAR) again, as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country. Russia later filed an appeal to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) against the WADA decision.

After reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17 December 2020 to reduce the penalty WADA had placed on Russia. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate in the Olympics and other international events, but for two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as ""Neutral Athlete"" or ""Neutral Team."" The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display ""Russia"" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the ""Neutral Athlete/Team"" designation.

On 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym ""ROC"" after the name of the [[Russian Olympic Committee]] although the name of the committee itself in full could not be used to refer to the delegation. Russia would be represented by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee.

On 8 September 2021, the IOC Executive Board suspended the [[Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (North Korea) through at least the end of 2022 for violations of the [[Olympic Charter]], over its refusal to send athletes to the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo due to COVID-19 pandemic-related concerns. North Korean athletes would be allowed to participate under the Olympic flag. However, North Korean Ministry of Sports and the National Olympic Committee said in a letter to the [[Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|2022 Beijing Winter Olympics Organizing Committee]], the [[Chinese Olympic Committee]], and the [[General Administration of Sport of China]] on 7 January 2022 that ""Due to the ""action of hostile forces"" and the COVID-19 pandemic, they would not be able to participate in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics."" In addition, the North Korean Olympic Committee said ""supports all the work of our comrades in China to host a grand and wonderful Olympics. The United States and its followers are plotting anti-Chinese conspiracies to obstruct the successful hosting of the Olympics, but this is an insult to the spirit of the Olympic Charter and an act to damage China's international image. We firmly oppose and reject these actions.""

The following 91 [[National Olympic Committee]]s have qualified athletes (two fewer than four years earlier), with [[Haiti]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] making their Winter Olympic débuts. Kenya qualified one athlete, but withdrew.

=== Emblem ===

[[File:冬奥主题花坛 开放冬奥.jpg|thumb|Flower bed along Chang'an Avenue.]]

The emblem for the 2022 Winter Olympics, ""Winter Dream"" (冬梦), was unveiled on 15 December 2017 at the [[Beijing National Aquatics Center]]. Designed by Lin Cunzhen (who previously designed the emblem of the [[2014 Summer Youth Olympics]] in [[Nanjing]]), the emblem is a stylised rendition of the Chinese character for winter (冬) as a multi-coloured ribbon, reflecting upon the landscapes of the host region. The beginning of the ribbon symbolizes an ice skater, while the end of the ribbon symbolizes a skier. The emblem carries a blue, red, and yellow colour scheme: the latter two colours represent both the [[flag of China]], and ""passion, youth, and vitality""."

[[Bing Dwen Dwen and Shuey Rhon Rhon|Bing Dwen Dwen]] was the mascot of the 2022 Winter Olympics. Bing Dwen Dwen was chosen from thousands of Chinese designs in 35 countries worldwide. ""Bing"" (冰) means ice in Chinese, and was meant to suggest purity and strength. ""Dwen Dwen"" (墩墩) was meant to suggest robustness, liveliness, and youth. Bing Dwen Dwen's astronaut-like clothes implied that the Winter Olympics embraced new technologies and created possibilities."

{{main|List of 2022 Winter Olympics broadcasters}}

In China, domestic rights to these Games were owned by [[China Media Group]] (CMG), with rights being sublicensed by [[China Mobile]]'s Migu streaming service. In some countries, broadcast rights to the 2022 Winter Olympics were already agreed upon through existing long-term deals. In France and the United Kingdom, these were the first Games where [[Eurosport]] would be the main rightsholder; the [[BBC]] sub-licensed a limited amount of coverage on free-to-air television, as part of a deal in which the BBC sold the pay-TV rights to the 2018 and 2020 Games to Eurosport. In January 2022, the BBC announced it would broadcast over 300 hours of free-to-air live coverage, as well as highlights programmes.

The scheduling of the Games impacted the U.S. broadcast rights to the [[Super Bowl]]—the championship game of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), and historically the [[List of most watched television broadcasts in the United States|most-watched television broadcast in the United States]] annually—as the game's date fell within an ongoing Olympic Games for the first time in its history. Under the NFL's broadcast rights at the time, the rights to the Super Bowl alternated annually between [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and long-time Olympic broadcaster [[NBC]] (whose [[Super Bowl LII|last Super Bowl]] also fell in a Winter Olympic year, but was held prior to the opening ceremony). To prevent the Games from [[Counterprogramming (television)|competing]] for viewership and advertising sales with [[Super Bowl LVI]]—which was scheduled for 13 February 2022 at Los Angeles' [[SoFi Stadium]]—CBS and NBC announced in March 2019 that they would invert the rights for Super Bowl LVI and [[Super Bowl LV|LV (2021)]], so that both the 2022 Winter Olympics and Super Bowl LVI would be broadcast by NBC. In a break from the established practice of airing [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|premieres or special episodes]] of entertainment programmes after the Super Bowl to take advantage of its large audience, NBC aired its [[prime time]] coverage for Day 10 of the Games immediately following Super Bowl LVI. Furthermore, the NFL's new media rights beginning in 2023 extends the Super Bowl rotation to four networks by adding [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[ESPN]], thus codifying this scenario by giving NBC rights to the Super Bowl in 2026, 2030, and 2034, all of which are Winter Olympic years.

These Games also confirmed an ongoing trend in U.S. viewership of the Olympics; while television viewership had seen a further decline, they were offset by increases in [[social media]] engagement and [[Streaming media|streaming]] viewership of the Games. Similar trends were seen in Europe, where amidst falling TV ratings Eurosport reported an eight-fold increase in streaming viewership on its platforms and [[Discovery+]] over Pyeongchang 2018."

During the bidding process, critics questioned the Beijing bid, arguing that the proposed outdoor venue sites do not have reliable snowfall in winter for snow sports. Concerns have been raised that snow may need to be transported to the venues at great cost and with uncertain environmental consequences.

Additional concerns about weather conditions were raised during certain events. Swedish athlete [[Frida Karlsson]] nearly collapsed after the [[Cross-country skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Women's 15 kilometre skiathlon|women's skiathlon]] due to low temperatures.

As in 2008, activists, human rights groups, and diplomats made calls to boycott the Olympic Games when hosted by China. In the aftermath of the 2019 leak of the [[Xinjiang papers]], the [[2019–2020 Hong Kong protests]], and the [[persecution of Uyghurs in China]], calls were made for a boycott of the 2022 Games. Because of these issues, the selection of an athlete from Xinjiang as part of the final torchbearers received a mixed reaction.<ref name="":2"" />

In February 2021, the [[Chinese Communist Party]]-owned tabloid ''[[Global Times]]'' warned that China could ""seriously sanction any country that follows a boycott."" In March 2021, Chinese spokesperson Guo Weimin stated that any attempt to boycott the Olympics would be doomed to fail. China's Foreign Minister [[Wang Yi (politician)|Wang Yi]] also told the [[EU]]'s foreign policy chief [[Josep Borrell]] that they should attend the games to ""enhance exchanges on winter sport"", and to ""foster new highlights"" in bilateral cooperation.

The IOC stated that it remains neutral in all global political issues and that the award of hosting the games does not signal agreement with the host country's political or social situation or its human rights standards. The committee's response to [[Agence France-Presse]] read: ""We've repeatedly said it: the IOC isn't responsible for the government. It only gives the rights and opportunity for the staging of the Olympic Games. That doesn't mean we agree with all the politics, all the social or human rights issues in the country. And it doesn't mean we approve of all the human rights violations of a person or people."" The statement attracted criticism, with [[Pacific University]] professor [[Jules Boykoff]] accusing the IOC of ""hypocrisy"".<ref name=""politico.eu"" />

On 19 November 2021, a group of 17 members of the Lithuanian national parliament [[Seimas]] released an official letter encouraging [[Lithuania]] to withdraw from the 2022 Winter Olympics due to human rights violations in China.  On 3 December 2021, Lithuania was the first nation to announce a diplomatic boycott of the games.

After the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]] in late February 2022, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a report alleging that China requested Russia to delay the invasion until after the Olympics to avoid damaging the Games' public image. Russia invaded [[Ukraine]] just four days after the Games' Closing Ceremony.  Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the [[Embassy of China, Washington, D.C.|Chinese Embassy in Washington]], has rejected the claims as ""speculations without any basis, and intended to blame-shift and smear China""."

=== American diplomatic boycott ===

{{see also|Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics#Diplomatic boycotts or non-attendance}}

The United States boycott of China's [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] was predominantly due to [[Chinese human rights issues|China's human rights issues]] on topics such as the systematic oppression of the Uyghurs, [[Chinese Tibetans|Tibetans]] and the [[2019–2020 Hong Kong protests|riots in Hong Kong]] in 2019. The Chinese government implemented many coercive activities in those regions, such as the [[Xinjiang internment camps|reeducation camps]], mass detention camps, and [[Great Firewall|restricted access to social media]]."

== Concerns and controversies ==

=== American diplomatic boycott ===

==== Key event timeline ====

In October 2018, American senator [[Marco Rubio]], [[Jeff Merkley|Senator Jeff Merkley]], and Congressmen [[Jim McGovern (American politician)|Jim McGovern]] and [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] sent a letter, on behalf of the [[Congressional-Executive Commission on China]] (CECC), to the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) requesting the revocation of China's host right on the 2022 Winter Olympics. The letter stated that ""no Olympics should be held in a country whose government is committing genocide and crimes against humanity.""

In November 2021, [[Joe Biden|President Biden]] proposed ""a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics."" The United States was aware of the prospective harsh punishment of being suspended by the National Olympic Committee and was careful regarding the scale and severity of the boycott.<ref name=""auto1""/>

In December 2021, the [[Presidency of Joe Biden|Biden administration]] officially initiated a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, restricting United States government officials' presence at the games. The attendance of [[United States at the Olympics|Team USA]] athletes was not affected by the diplomatic boycott."
"2022 Winter Olympics

== Concerns and controversies ==

=== American diplomatic boycott ===

==== Reactions ====

The IOC remained relatively neutral regarding the letter from CECC or the boycott. The IOC negotiated with the Chinese government on specific protocols to ensure the Olympic Games ran smoothly, such as providing unrestricted internet access to foreign journalists.<ref name=""auto1"" />

From China's perspective, the United States was ""politicizing sports"" with the Biden Boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] spokesperson, [[Zhao Lijian]], accused the United States of violating the spirit of political neutrality endorsed in the [[Olympic Charter]], emphasizing that an Olympic game should not be a place for political posturing and manipulation. China announced that the United States was not yet officially invited by the host committee; thus, the United States should not have initiated the boycott in the first place.

Following the United States, many countries in the Western world decided to join the diplomatic boycott to show disapproval of China's human rights issues.<ref name=""auto1"" />"

===Environmental impact===

{{see also|Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics#Environmental and health issues}}
An estimated {{convert|49|e6gal}} of water was expected to be used to [[Snowmaking|create snow]] at the various venues. [[Pyeongchang]], South Korea, which held the [[2018 Winter Olympics|previous Winter Olympics]], also had a cold but similarly arid climate that required vast quantities of [[artificial snow]]. Professor Carmen de Jong, a geographer at the [[University of Strasbourg]], argued that these would be the ""most unsustainable"" Winter Olympics in history. The IOC stated that ""a series of water-conserving and recycling designs have been put into place to optimize water usage for snowmaking, human consumption, and other purposes.{{Update inline|date=February 2022}}

Artificial snow forms a harder piste compared to real snow. It is often favoured by professionals for being fast and ""hyper-grippy"" but also raises their fear of falling on it. American snowboarder [[Jamie Anderson (snowboarder)|Jamie Anderson]] compared it to ""pretty bulletproof ice"" while her teammate Courtney Rummel compared it to the man-made snow in [[Wisconsin]].<ref name=afp2022feb2 />
	
According to [[Jules Boykoff]] in February 2022, Beijing's electricity came largely from coal and this coal power was what supported the construction of some Olympic venues. To offset emissions from construction and air travel, China had planted roughly 60 million trees."

===Sporting controversies===

{{see also|Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics#Sporting controversies}}
There were concerns about decisions and disqualification in several events during the games. These issues included the following: 
* An official appeal to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] over the disqualification of two South Korean athletes from the men's 1000 metres short track speed skating event filed by the [[Korean Sport & Olympic Committee]], after having their protests rejected by the [[International Skating Union]]. 
* Controversy surrounding a ruling of an obstruction in the [[Short track speed skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's 5000 metre relay|5000 metres relay event]].
* A potential missed call by judges during the [[Snowboarding at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's slopestyle|men's snowboard slopestyle]] and [[Snowboarding at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's halfpipe|men's half pipe event]] events. 
* A ruling of a false start in the men's [[Speed skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's 500 metres|500 metres speed skating event]].
* The disqualification of racers for their uniforms during the [[Ski jumping at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Mixed team|mixed team normal hill event]] of ski jumping.
* The continued participation of the figure skater [[Kamila Valieva]] in the [[Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Women's singles|women's singles competition]] after a preliminary positive drug test from a sample 2 months prior.
* Three athletes failed the doping test during the Olympics and were suspended: Iranian alpine skier [[Hossein Saveh-Shemshaki]], Ukrainian cross-country skier [[Valiantsina Kaminskaya]], and Ukrainian bobsledder [[Lidiia Hunko]]. The positive test of the Spanish figure skater [[Laura Barquero]] was announced after the Olympics.
* U.S. skater [[Joey Mantia]] alleged that South Korean skater [[Lee Seung-hoon (speed skater)|Lee Seung-hoon]] made contact with him and pulled him back, preventing him from winning a bronze medal in the [[Speed skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's mass start|Mass Start]] final. Mantia lost by a 0.002-second margin. Team USA challenged the result, but Lee was awarded the bronze medal."

===Athlete and officials complaints===

{{see also|Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics#Athletes and team officials complaints}}
The food and overall conditions in [[quarantine]] hotels given to athletes testing positive for COVID-19 were criticised early on. Team officials from delegations including Belgium, Germany, Poland, Finland and the Russian Olympic Committee all brought up issues their athletes faced in quarantine hotels, among them were the lack of internet connections, low-quality food, insufficient facilities and no training equipment.

With China's [[Zero-COVID]] policy, there were issues raised about the process of quarantine at the games. According to ''[[Newsweek]]'' and [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']], the hotels' conditions appeared to have improved after the athletes' complaints were made public.

There were some complaints about the food served outside of quarantine. Germany's [[Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's downhill|alpine]] coach Christian Schweiger called the catering ""extremely questionable"" for not having hot meals but he echoed athletes from several nations that the food at the nearby Athletes' Village was great. Austrian skier [[Matthias Mayer]] said that [[Kitzbühel#Sport|Kitzbuehel]] would have offered ""the best of the best"" but also that a hot meal right before a race might not bring out top performances.

Other complaints included low temperatures and related safety concerns. Sweden's [[Frida Karlsson]] nearly collapsed at the conclusion of the [[Cross-country skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Women's 15 kilometre skiathlon|women's skiathlon cross-country race]]. Afterwards, her team considered requesting that races held in afternoons and evenings for European TV audiences be moved to earlier during the day. Some athletes resorted to putting tape on their faces and noses to protect them from the bitter cold. Heavy snowfall disrupted a number of competition and training events on 13 February. Thirty-three skiers did not finish their first run of the [[Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's giant slalom|men's giant slalom]]. [[Henrik Kristoffersen]] of Norway said that he ""couldn't see shit."" Switzerland's [[Loic Meillard]] said, ""It's not what I was hoping for but it's part of the game ... we've raced in conditions like that before."""

{{Main|2022 Winter Olympics}}
The [[2022 Winter Olympics]] took place between the 4 and 20 February 2022 and were hosted by in China in the capital city of Beijing. The country selected was the subject of various concerns and controversies about their [[Cost of the Olympic Games|cost]], [[Environmental issues|environmental impact]], [[Censorship in China|censorship]], [[Chinese intelligence activity abroad|espionage]], [[COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19]], [[sportswashing]], and [[Human rights in China|human rights issues]].

There have been [[diplomatic boycott]]s of the Olympics largely due to the human rights situation in China, and the [[persecution of Uyghurs in China]] in particular. Additional reasons for diplomatic boycotts include China's alleged politicization of the games.<ref name=""WP20220203""/>"
"Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics

==Criticism of host selection==

American sportscaster [[Bob Costas]] criticized the [[International Olympic Committee]]'s (IOC) decision to award the games to China saying ""The IOC deserves all of the disdain and disgust that comes their way for going back to China yet again"" referencing China's human rights record.

After winning two gold medals and returning to his home country of Sweden skater [[Nils van der Poel]] criticized the IOC's selection of China as the host saying ""I think it is extremely irresponsible to give it to a country that violates human rights as blatantly as the Chinese regime is doing."" He had declined to criticize China before leaving for the games saying ""I don't think it would be particularly wise for me to criticize the system I'm about to transition to, if I want to live a long and productive life."""
"Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics

==Organizing concerns and controversies==

===Cost and climate===

Several cities withdrew their applications during [[Bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics|the bidding process]], citing the high costs or the lack of local support to host the 2022 games, leaving [[Almaty]] in Kazakhstan and Beijing as the only candidate cities by 1 October 2014.

The decision to bid for the Olympics was controversial in China (and outside), because Beijing itself, and especially some of the proposed outdoor venues, would not have reliable snowfall in winter for snow sports. Concerns have been raised that snow may need to be transported to the venues at great cost and with uncertain environmental consequences."
"Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics

==Organizing concerns and controversies==

===Promotional song===

Some commentators alleged that one of the early promotional songs for the [[2022 Winter Olympics]], ""The Snow and Ice Dance"", sung by [[Sun Nan]] and [[Tan Jing]], had suspicious similarities with ""[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]"", one of the songs from the 2013 [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film, ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''. A Chinese media outlet cited technical analysis of the two songs: both songs employ a piano as the major instrument, have similar prelude chords and an eight-beat introduction, and they run at almost exactly the same tempo."

Several countries declined to send any diplomats or official representatives to the games. The following countries have either specifically called their non-attendance a ""boycott"" or have explicitly stated that their non-attendance is due to human rights concerns:

* Various Czech politicians have publicly disagreed on whether they consider the Czech position to be a boycott, due to the attendance of Czech ambassador to Beijing Vladimír Tomšík.
* Germany has cited both the pandemic and the [[Peng Shuai]] case, but also stated that a diplomatic boycott would be ""ineffective"".
* Japan has explicitly denied that they consider their position to be a boycott.
* Latvia's president and cabinet refused to attend the games, officially due to ""various circumstances including COVID-19 restrictions"", but also explicitly denied that their position was a boycott and sent Latvian ambassador to China Maija Manika.
* North Korea also stated that they would not attend the games due to the pandemic; however due to the suspension of their [[Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|NOC]], their officials would not have been permitted to attend regardless."

=== Background ===

[[File:Boycott Chinese Winter Olympics Protest.jpg|thumb|Protests against Chinese Winter Olympics held in Lausanne, Switzerland]]

After China had won the bid to host the 2022 Olympics, many Tibetan protesters had criticized the IOC for allowing China to host the games again due to its policies against Tibetans. In the aftermath of the 2019 leak of the [[Xinjiang papers]], the [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests]], [[Wolf warrior diplomacy|China's hostage diplomacy]] and the persecution of Uyghurs in China, calls were made for a boycott of the 2022 Games. In November 2021 the [[Disappearance of Peng Shuai|disappearance]] of former Olympian [[Peng Shuai]] after she made allegations of sexual assault against [[Zhang Gaoli]], former [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|Vice Premier of China]] and a high ranking [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) member, has put pressure on the International Olympic Committee.

Some human rights organizations have called for a diplomatic boycott that would mean countries not sending their heads of state or high-ranking officials to the Olympics but still sending athletes. In a 30 July 2020 letter, the [[World Uyghur Congress]] urged the IOC to reconsider holding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing because of the Uyghur genocide. The World Uyghur Congress does not support a full boycott; instead, they want athletes to use the games as a chance to raise awareness about the Uyghur genocide, similar to the way that athletes have raised the profile of the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement.<ref name=""Associated Press"">{{cite news|last1=Wade|first1=Stephen|title=More questions on human rights for Beijing Winter Olympics|url=https://apnews.com/article/winter-olympics-juan-antonio-samaranch-beijing-2020-tokyo-olympics-china-d03b46950b26420664677b8d1aa8caa2|url-status=live|date=16 October 2020

In March 2021, the IOC president [[Thomas Bach]] opposed a boycott, which would also damage the IOC image and finances, and said that the IOC must stay out of politics.

On 23 June 2021 (Olympic Day), multiple Tibetan, Uyghur, Hongkonger, Chinese, Taiwanese and Southern Mongolian representatives staged protests in 50 cities worldwide, calling for a mass boycott.

On 7 September 2021, human rights groups called on Olympics broadcasters, including [[NBC]], to cancel the broadcasting plans for 2022 Olympics due to China's human rights issue.

In January 2022, it was reported that the United States is considering legislation to strip the IOC of its federal tax-exempt status in response to the IOC's ""refusal to challenge China on human rights abuses"".

More than 200 human rights organizations have voiced support for a boycott of the games. Groups protesting the games have called them the ""Genocide Games."""

=== United States ===

{{Further|China–United States relations}}
In October 2018, Senator [[Marco Rubio]], on behalf of the U.S. [[Congressional-Executive Commission on China]], asked that China be deprived of the hosting rights for the 2022 Olympics due to the ""dire human rights situation"" there. In September 2020, United States Senator [[Rick Scott]] spoke with the IOC Vice President about reconsidering the IOC's decision to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in China. On 25 February 2021, U.S. Representative [[John Katko]] stated that China is ""a country that's engaged in genocide"" and called upon the United States to boycott participation in the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]. In March 2021, Senator [[Mitt Romney]] called for an ""economic and diplomatic boycott"" of the 2022 Winter Olympics, in which U.S. athletes would still participate, but no American spectators or dignitaries would attend. In May 2021, Speaker of the House [[Nancy Pelosi]] called for a diplomatic boycott and said heads of state should not ""honor China"" by attending the Olympic Games. In July 2021, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China called on the IOC to relocate or postpone the games.

In April 2021, it was reported that the [[Biden administration]] was ""not discussing any joint boycott with allies and partners.""

In a survey taken in August 2021, 49 per cent of Americans believe that China's human rights record should prevent it from hosting the winter Olympics in 2022 and 33 per cent are not sure.

On 18 November 2021, President [[Joe Biden]] said the U.S. is ""considering"" a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Some, like US senator [[Tom Cotton]], called for a full boycott of the games, which would bar U.S. athletes from competing and bar U.S. companies from sponsoring the games. Due to a change in the last version of the Olympic Charter, a full boycott by the United States, like the one at the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], could result in the most severe punishment, which is the suspension by the National Olympic Committee for 2 years of the Olympic Games, a similar situation to what happened with North Korea in the 2020 games.

On 6 December 2021, White House Press Secretary, [[Jen Psaki]], announced that the [[Joe Biden|Biden]] administration would initiate a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics and the 2022 Winter Paralympics. The diplomatic boycott would bar all US government officials from attending the games in an official capacity. The White House cited China's mistreatment of the Uyghur people as the reason for the boycott. The White House said it stopped short of a full boycott, because ""it would not be fair to punish athletes who have trained for years"".<ref name=""CNN20211206""/>

On 27 December 2021, the Chinese foreign ministry said it has received visa applications for 18 US officials to attend the games. The US said that the visa applications were consistent with its diplomatic boycott as the applicants would only be providing ""consular and diplomatic security services"" to its athletes."

{{Further|Australia–China relations}}
China's alleged use of coercive diplomacy against Australia has led to increased calls within Australia to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics. In November 2020, Australian Senators [[Jacqui Lambie]] and [[Rex Patrick]] officially proposed a boycott, but their proposal was voted down. Australia has decided that no Australian based politician or officials will be attending the games, and Canberra has also refused to sign the Olympic Truce for the 2022 Winter Olympics.
 
On 7 December 2021, Australian Prime Minister [[Scott Morrison]] stated that Australia would join with the United States in the diplomatic boycott of the 2022 games. He stated that it was ""human rights abuses,"" referencing the ongoing genocide of Uyghur Muslims in China's Xinjiang region, as well as ""many other issues that Australia has consistently raised"". He went on to state that it was ""no surprise"" that Canberra would do this following consistent deterioration of relations between Canberra and Beijing. Morrison also stated that the decision was ""in Australia's national interest,"" and that it is the ""right thing to do.""<ref name=""BBC20211208""/>"

After it was revealed that [[People's Liberation Army]] regimental commander Qi Fabao, who led the Chinese troops during skirmishes against Indian troops during the [[2020–2021 China–India skirmishes|2020 Galwan Valley clash]], would be one of the torchbearers during the opening ceremony of the games, [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|Indian Ministry of External Affairs]] spokesperson Arindam Bagchi stated: ""It is indeed regrettable that the Chinese side has chosen to politicize an event like the Olympics"". Bagchi also stated that the ''[[chargé d'affaires]]'' of the [[Embassy of India, Beijing|Embassy of India in Beijing]] will not attend the opening or closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics. The CEO of [[Prasar Bharati]], India's public broadcaster, announced that they will not air the 2022 Winter Olympics opening and closing ceremony.

Qi Fabao had been captured in June 2020 by Indian forces when he tried to mount an attack on Indian forces in the Galwan Valley, according to an investigative report by the Australian newspaper ''The Klaxon''. According to the report, 38 Chinese troops drowned in the early stages of the 15–16 June face-off between Indian and Chinese forces while attempting to cross the [[Galwan River]] at [[Line of Actual Control]] in the dark. The Chinese government accepted four casualties.<ref name=""India Today"" />"

=== Calls for boycotts by other countries ===

In a non-binding motion in February 2021, the Canadian House of Commons called for the IOC to move the Olympics to a new location. In a nationwide survey conducted in March 2021, 54% of Canadians said the country should boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, while 24% believed it should not and 21% were not sure.

In July 2021, the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] voted in favor of a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics.

On 19 November 2021, 17 members of the Lithuanian national parliament [[Seimas]] released an official letter encouraging [[Lithuania]] to withdraw from the 2022 Olympics due human rights violations in China. [[Daina Gudzinevičiūtė]], president of [[National Olympic Committee of Lithuania]], released a statement that Olympic games should be politically neutral and confirmed that committee has no plans to boycott the games. Lithuania's president, Gitanas Nauseda, released a statement confirming the Lithuanian diplomatic boycott on 3 December 2021. This was due to concerns of human rights abuses in China.

On 8 December 2021, the United Kingdom and Canada joined the United States and Australia, whom both announced diplomatic boycotts of the 2022 Winter Olympics.

In December 2021, the government of [[Latvia]] announced that it would not send diplomats to the games.<ref name=""bnn-news.com""/>

In January 2022, the governments of Sweden, [[Denmark]], and the [[Netherlands]] separately announced that they will not send diplomats to the games.<ref name=""reuters20220114""/>"
"Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics

== Diplomatic boycotts or non-attendance ==

=== Chinese Government response ===

In February 2021, the Chinese Communist Party-owned tabloid ''[[Global Times]]'' warned that China could ""seriously sanction any country that follows a boycott."" In March 2021, Chinese spokesperson Guo Weimin stated that any attempt to boycott the Olympics would be doomed to fail. Chinese Foreign Minister [[Wang Yi (politician)|Wang Yi]] also told the EU's foreign policy chief [[Josep Borrell]] that they should attend the games to ""enhance exchanges on winter sport,"" and to ""foster new highlights"" in bilateral cooperation.

On 29 November 2021, Chinese media reported that China reportedly does not plan to invite Western politicians who threaten a diplomatic boycott to the Beijing Winter Olympics."
"Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics

== Diplomatic boycotts or non-attendance ==

=== IOC response ===

The IOC has stated that the diplomatic boycotts are ""a purely political decision for each government, which the IOC in its political neutrality fully respects."" It has also stated that the award of hosting the games does not signal agreement with the host country's political or social situation or its human rights standards. When prompted by [[Agence France-Presse]], the IOC responded: ""We've repeatedly said it: the IOC isn't responsible for the government. It only gives the rights and opportunity for the staging of the Olympic Games. That doesn't mean we agree with all the politics, all the social or human rights issues in the country. And it doesn't mean we approve of all the human rights violations of a person or people."" This position has generated criticism, with [[Jules Boykoff]] accusing the IOC of hypocrisy by saying that it ignores its charter that promotes equality and anti-discrimination when it is convenient to do so and that the IOC has shown an ""unfortunate propensity for turning away from human rights atrocities to make sure that the games go on.""<ref name=""politico.eu"" />

On 8 September 2021, after the IOC suspended the [[Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|North Korean NOC]] for not being present at the [[2020 Summer Olympics]], there was speculation about whether the IOC was also intending to send a message to nations considering a boycott of the games that they could be banned from participation in future Olympic Games if they chose to boycott this edition. On 14 October 2021, the executive vice-president of the IOC, Australian [[John Coates (sports administrator)|John Coates]], said that the IOC would not challenge the Chinese government over the issue of the Uyghurs, stating that it was ""not within the IOC's remit"".<ref name=""Reuters""/>

However, during the [[2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]], IOC president, [[Thomas Bach]] had called for the end of various types of discrimination during his speech indirectly referring to the human rights abuses in China. On 17 February 2022 towards the end of the Games, when a [[Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|BOCOG]] spokesperson referred to questions about Xinjiang as ""lies"", the IOC reminded BOCOG to remain politically neutral."

===Quarantine facilities===

Polish short track speed skater [[Natalia Maliszewska]] posted on Twitter, ""I don't believe in anything anymore. In no tests. No games. It's a big joke for me"" after a series of mistakes by Chinese officials conducting COVID-19 tests on her. Meanwhile, Finnish men's ice hockey team's coach [[Jukka Jalonen]] accused China of not respecting the human rights of athlete [[Marko Anttila]], who had not received food and was under a lot of stress while in quarantine.

On February 2, Belgian skeleton athlete [[Kim Meylemans]] posted on social media and was in tears about the conditions she faced while in quarantine. Meylemans was supposed to be transported to the village after her time in quarantine was over, but was transported to a different quarantine facility instead. After the video was posted, Belgian Olympic team officials and the [[International Olympic Committee]] had to intervene, and Meylemans was moved to the Athletes Village in Yanqing. Moreover, Dirk Schimmelpfennig, Germany's [[chef de mission]] called the hotel accommodations provided for Olympic gold medalist in Nordic Combined [[Eric Frenzel]] as ""unreasonable""."

===Food===

The food being served at the games was also criticized. During the [[Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's downhill|men's downhill event]] in alpine skiing, German coach Christian Schweiger said the following, ""the catering is extremely questionable. I would have expected that the Olympic Committee is capable of providing hot meals, there are crisps, some nuts and chocolate and nothing else. This shows a lack of focus on high-performance sport"". Also, Russian Olympic Committee biathlete [[Valeria Vasnetsova]] posted on social media that she was served the same food for all three meals and posted ""My stomach hurts, I'm very pale and I have huge black circles around my eyes"". Vasnetsova said she was only able to eat the pasta served as the rest of the food was inedible. The [[United States at the 2022 Winter Olympics|United States]] delegation brought extra food, such as bags of pasta, anticipating issues with the food at the games. Also, a manager from a restaurant in the ""bubble"" for the games admitted the food served there was ""disgusting"" and only low quality packaged food items were available at the Main Media Centre. The [[International Olympic Committee]] would release a statement acknowledging the issues raised by athletes, ""particularly with regard to food temperature, variety and portion size"".<ref name=ps/>"

Other complaints included the weather conditions at the games, with athletes raising complaints about competing in unsafe weather conditions. The Swedish team requested the races be moved to earlier in the day to protect athletes from the cold weather. This was done after athlete [[Frida Karlsson]] nearly fainted at the conclusion of the [[Cross-country skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Women's 15 kilometre skiathlon|women's skiathlon cross-country race]].

{{Further|Doping in Russia}}
On 9 December 2019, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with lab data that it provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the [[Russian Anti-Doping Agency]] being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA will allow individually cleared [[Russian Olympic Committee athletes at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Russian athletes]] to take part in the 2022 Winter Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics. The title of the neutral banner was yet to be determined; WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use ""[[Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics|Olympic Athletes from Russia]]"" (OAR) as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country.

Russia later filed an appeal to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) against the WADA decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport, on review of Russia's appeal of its case from WADA, ruled on 17 December 2020, to reduce the penalty that WADA had placed from four to two years. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as ""Neutral Athlete"" or ""Neutral Team"". The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display ""Russia"" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the ""Neutral Athlete/Team"" designation.

The IOC announced on 19 February 2021 that Russia would compete in both the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] (which was postponed to 2021 due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]) and 2022 Winter Olympics under the acronym ""ROC"", after the name of the [[Russian Olympic Committee]]. The ROC team would be represented by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee. On 22 April 2021, the IOC approved a fragment of [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|Piano Concerto No. 1]] to be used in place of the Russian national anthem."

Three people, Chemi Lhamo, Fern MacDougal and Jason Leith, were arrested and detained for several days. They were charged and their trial was set to occur immediately before the games opened but it was immediately adjourned and a new date set for 1 December 2022.

The Chinese government's internet troll networks were mobilized before the Games to support government messaging. This has included campaigns of intimidation against human rights activists abroad. The [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|Ministry of Public Security]]'s [[Spamouflage]] [[disinformation]] network transitioned to primarily push Olympic messaging in December 2021.

In the run up to the Olympics, the Chinese government deployed dozens of fake Twitter accounts to push the Government's position in the [[disappearance of Peng Shuai|Peng Shuai scandal]] and the IOC's involvement. ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[ProPublica]] identified a network of more than 3,000 inauthentic-looking Twitter accounts that appeared to be coordinating. Such accounts appeared to operate solely to amplify state media, as most of these accounts were recently created with very few followers, and their activity consisted solely of reposting China comments including from one account called ""Spicy Panda"" whose cartoons and videos rallied against the Olympic boycott. A Twitter spokesperson said that hundreds of accounts included in the investigation's findings have since been suspended for violating the ""platform manipulation and spam policy,"" which prohibits ""coordinated activity that attempts to artificially influence conversations through the use of multiple accounts, fake accounts and automation."""

===Espionage directed at athletes===

{{Further|Mass surveillance in China}}
China's espionage of athletes serves its political interests as well as addresses safety and COVID concerns. The [[smartphone app]] associated with the games, My2022, has been a particular subject of espionage concern.

All attendees to the Games, including athletes, audience members, and media, are required to use the My2022 app purportedly for daily Covid monitoring. The cybersecurity group [[Citizen Lab]], a research institute at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, warned that the My2022 app fails to provide encryption on many of its files, and has security weaknesses that leave users exposed to [[data breach]]es. The Citizen Lab disclosed the concerns about the app on 3 December 2021, giving the organizing 15 days to respond and 45 days to fix the issues.  A new iOS version of MY2022 was released on 6 January 2022, which failed to fix these problems, while adding a new ""Green Health Code"", feature that collects more medical data and also lacks [[SSL certificate]] validation making it vulnerable to attacks.

Numerous Olympic committees, including the [[British Olympic Association]], the [[Australian Olympic Committee]], [[Canadian Olympic Committee]], [[Dutch Olympic Committee|NOC*NSF]], and [[United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee]], have recommended that attendees use [[burner phones]], [[virtual private networks]] (VPNs), and create email accounts for their time in China, while leaving personal smartphones and laptops at home.

Cyber security firm Internet 2.0 has also warned of potential security risks during the Olympics, when it examined the technology sponsors of the Games and their products that show ""the sophisticated and broad surveillance culture that exists in China"". Internet 2.0 noted that ""China's national data security laws are not designed with the Western values of [[privacy]] and liberty and do not offer the same level of protection"" as the laws allow the government to request access to the user data captured by these products.<ref name=""bbc.com""/>"

Huang later removed the video post of her wearing the outfit, due to the social media backlash that came afterwards. According to a translation by the ''South China Morning Post'', Huang separately made a post on Facebook where she wrote, ""Thank you to everyone who cheered me up...I have removed the video due to too many unnecessary private messages!...""Sport is sport and in the world of sports, we do not differentiate between nationalities. After the Games, we all are good friends.""

[[Ho Chih-wei]], a [[Legislative Yuan]] member of the ruling [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) criticised Huang Yu-Ting, calling her ""brainless"" and demanding that she ""shut up"", as well as supporting a law that would punish athletes such as Huang with bans from sport events. Taiwan Premier [[Su Tseng-chang]] from the ruling DPP called for an investigation and punishment for Huang.

National identity is a highly sensitive issue in Taiwan.

In the Final A race, [[Shaolin Sándor Liu]] from Hungary was disqualified after crossing the finish line first, ultimately resulting in [[Ren Ziwei]] and Li Wenlong of China who finished after Liu to be awarded with the gold and silver medal, respectively. After the event, both the South Korean and the Hungarian team filed protests to the [[International Skating Union]].
   
The [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) received and rejected the two protests from Hungary and South Korea on February 7, 2022. The ISU stated that the decisions in regards to any disqualification for rule violations cannot be challenged, adding that their Chief Referee had reviewed the incident with the Video Referee and stood by the final decisions. According to the ISU, Hwang Dae-heon was disqualified for the ""illegal late pass causing contact"" while the disqualification of Shaolin Sándor Liu was due to a ""straight lane change from inside to out causing contact"" and an ""arm block at the finish"".<ref name=""auto1""/> The [[Korean Sport & Olympic Committee]] later filed an official appeal to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]].<ref name=""auto2""/><ref name=""houston1""/>"

=== Women's 500 metre short-track speed-skating event===

After the close-up video of the incident surfaced on [[Reddit]], some viewers of the quarter-finals in the [[Short track speed skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Women's 500 metres|women's 500 metres short track speedskating event]] noticed and accused the Chinese skater [[Fan Kexin]] of reaching over the leg of another competitor to flick a track marker at the Canadian skater [[Alyson Charles]], which seemingly caused Charles to trip and crash along with Fan during the race. While no call was made on the incident, Charles was advanced to the semi-finals after it was assessed that she was impeded by another Canadian skater [[Florence Brunelle]] who got disqualified. Fan, who came in third after the crash, failed to advance.<ref name=""Global News"" />"

During the [[Short track speed skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's 5000 metre relay|5000 metres relay event]], also in short track speed skating, in the semifinals of the event, the Chinese team fell with 10 laps to go. This happened at a point in the race where [[Pascal Dion]] (from Canada) and a Chinese skater had their skates come into contact. The team was advanced to the A final, with no team disqualified during the race. The Chinese team were advanced, even though they finished last in the race and there was no impeding action on the team."

=== Men's snowboard slopestyle ===

In the men's [[Snowboarding at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's slopestyle|snowboard slopestyle]], Canada's [[Max Parrot]] had won the gold medal and China's [[Su Yiming]] won the silver. However the medal results stirred controversy on social media when BBC commentator [[Ed Leigh]] believed the gold medal should have been awarded to Su, and pointed out that Parrot, during his frontside 1440 in his second run, had actually committed a 'cardinal sin' by grabbing his knee instead of the board, and should have been deducted for it, but the judges had apparently failed to spot it. Replays showed him ""failing to grab his board and instead clutching around his lower leg, meaning that the maneuver was incomplete and should have been marked down. Leigh wrote in the BBC, ""The judges have put execution at such a premium that something like that should have cost him two or three points. So the gold has gone wrong there. ... I think Su Yiming actually took the gold there. This is a mistake on the judges' part.""

Moreover, bronze medalist [[Mark McMorris]] felt he had the best run of the day, and should have been the gold medalist, ""but knowing that I kind of had the run of the day and one of the best rounds of my life and the whole industry knows what happened"". Parrot, acknowledged the error and still felt like he deserved the gold medal, ""But in the end, it's a judged sport and the fact is I had the most technical run of the day on pretty much every feature"". Lead judge for the event, Iztok Sumatic said, ""there are so many factors. All I can say, in Max's defence, regarding this specific run, is that it was still an insane run. He killed it, especially on the rails."" Ultimately the blame lay with the [[Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|organizers]], who failed to provide multiple angles of the event. Parrot reviewed the runs by the three medalists and, ""he spotted three ""little mistakes"" during McMorris' turn, and also noted a few errors by Su"", while Parrot, ""didn't have any mistakes on five of the six features, and on the one jump, I had a bigger mistake""."

Public outrage was sparked by the controversially low judgment of Japanese snowboarder [[Ayumu Hirano|Ayumu Hirano's]] second run scoring which had made commentators and fans cry ""foul"" on the judges. Hirano then had to repeat the exceptional performance in his third run, and successfully landing the very ""dangerous"" triple cork again, this time under greater public scrutiny of the judges, and moving from second place to winning the gold medal."

=== Men's speed skating 500 metres ===

In the men's [[Speed skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's 500 metres|500 metres speed skating event]], a false start was called in the last two heats, one of which included current [[2021–22 ISU Speed Skating World Cup|World Cup]] champion [[Laurent Dubreuil]]. This was questioned by [[1992 Winter Olympics]] Champion [[Bart Veldkamp]], who called it ""very suspicious"". According to Yetta Claytone of the Taylor Daily Press, due to the false start, Dubreuil had to be more cautious on his start, and his reaction time was slower than the initial start. According to Sportnieuws.nl, a false start would have disrupted the athletes' concentration, and also used up energy. However, Dubreuil believed the false start shouldn't be used as an excuse as it was, ""something that's totally possible to overcome and that it shouldn't make a difference""."

===Figure skating===

The medal ceremony for the [[Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Team event|figure skating team event]], originally scheduled for Tuesday, 8 February, was delayed over what [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) spokesperson Mark Adams described as a situation that required ""legal consultation"" with the [[International Skating Union]]. Several media outlets reported on Wednesday that the issue was over a positive test, held in December 2021, for [[trimetazidine]] by the ROC's [[Kamila Valieva]], which was officially confirmed on February 11. The results are pending investigation. The [[Russian Anti-Doping Agency]] (RUSADA), previously under suspension from the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) since 2015 for its years of serving solely to hide the positive doping results of Russian athletes (re-instated in September 2018), cleared Valieva on February 9, a day after the December test results were released, two months after the test. The IOC, WADA, and [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) are appealing RUSADA's decision.

On February 14, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) ruled that Valieva should be allowed to compete in the women's single event, deciding that preventing her from competing ""would cause her irreparable harm in the circumstances"", though her gold medal in the team event was still under consideration. The favorable decision from the court was made in part due to her age, as minor athletes are subject to different rules than adult athletes. The IOC announced that the medal ceremony would not take place until the investigation is over and there is a concrete decision whether to strip Russia of their medals.

By 9 March 2022, [[Travis Tygart]] of the [[USADA]] reported that Valieva had not requested that her ""B"" sample be tested, apparently accepting the results of initial testing and relying on her explanation that the banned substance TMZ belonged to her grandfather and only accidentally contaminated or became mixed into her own use of allowed nutrients and supplements. Tygart further stated that as a minor Valieva could still be either fully exculpated or given a warning concerning her testing positive depending on the extent of findings in the on-going [[RUSADA]] investigation of doping. According to Tygart, an adverse finding against her as a first offense could still be assessed as a two-year suspension, which is half of the suspension time which could be assessed for adults.

On 29 January 2024, the CAS disqualified Valieva for four years retroactive to 25 December 2021 for an anti-doping rule violation. On 30 January 2024, the ISU reallocated medals, upgrading the United States to gold and Japan to silver while downgrading ROC to bronze, but this decision has not yet been ratified by the IOC. Valieva would be made eligible for participation in the [[2026 Winter Olympics]] following her four-year suspension. However, the previous full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia in 2022 resulted in further sporting sanctions against Russia which remain in effect as of February&nbsp;2024. Russian athletes are currently allowed to compete at the Olympics as neutrals, with the Russian delegation called ''[[Individual Neutral Athletes at the 2024 Summer Olympics|Individual Neutral Athletes]]'' at the [[2024 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=""washingtonpost.com""/><ref name=""IOC pushes to cancel events in Russ""/>"

'''Rock'''{{Chinese script needed inline|date=August 2023}} is the Olympic [[Downhill (ski competition)|downhill]] ski course in [[China]], located in [[Yanqing District]], part of [[Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre|National Alpine Ski Centre]] resort, opened in 2022. 

It is approximately {{convert|90|km}} northwest of [[Beijing]], which hosted the speed [[Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics|alpine skiing events]] of the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]. The course was designed by [[Bernhard Russi]], assisted by [[Didier Defago]]; both are [[List of Olympic medalists in alpine skiing#Downhill|Olympic downhill champions]] ([[Alpine skiing at the 1972 Winter Olympics – Men's downhill|1972]], [[Alpine skiing at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Men's downhill|2010]]) from [[Switzerland]]. According to Russi, ""Rock"" is most similar to the ""[[Birds of Prey (ski course)|Birds of Prey]]"" course in the [[United States]], located at [[Beaver Creek Resort|Beaver Creek]], [[Colorado]].<ref name=""Siol""/>

This course has a very unusual terrain configuration, which has no resemblance to any other top level course around the world, as it runs mostly along the top of the ridge and in the canyon in bottom part.{{cn|date=August 2023}}"

== History ==

[[Bernhard Russi]], a retired Swiss downhill racer and course architect who planned and constructed six Olympic downhill courses, designed this very steep and unusual course for seven years.

Two years prior to the Olympics, men's [[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup|World Cup]] events (downhill, [[super-G]]) were scheduled for this course in February [[2019–20 FIS Alpine Ski World Cup|2020]], but were cancelled due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

On 7 February 2022, [[Beat Feuz]] took the gold medal at [[Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's downhill|downhill]], his last missing trophy, at premiere competition on this course. [[Adrian Smiseth Sejersted]] set the course top speed record at 139.7 km/h (86.8 mph)."

As the closing ceremony takes place five days after the Lantern Festival, which is the final day of the Chinese New Year celebrations, a performance was held to celebrate and promote the culture of the Chinese New Year through lanterns. Children danced and played with lanterns while interacting with the large snowflake cauldron in the center of the stadium. Their movement formed the emblem of the 2022 Winter Olympics. The lanterns were shaped like snowflakes to commemorate the overlap of both the Winter Olympics and the Chinese New Year celebration as well as to highlight the tradition of playing with lanterns during the Lantern Festival."

Continuing from the lantern performance, twelve sleds shaped in the form of Chinese zodiac animals, namely the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig, carved out a Chinese knot on the floor, joining the children with lanterns in continuing the celebration of the Chinese New Year. The zodiac animals represent the interlinkage of the Chinese calendar and its solar terms. Animations performed by ribbons wrapped around the giant snowflake cauldron to form a hybrid combination of the Chinese knot and the lantern. The flags of the 91 competing nations entered the stadium first, followed by all the athletes who were still in Beijing marching in together as one group accompanied by an arrangement of Beethoven's ''[[Ode to Joy]]''. The athletes gathered on the knot, symbolizing the Chinese culture of family reunion for the Chinese New Year."

===Milan-Cortina 2026: ""Duality, together""===

As per tradition, [[Milan]] and [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], the host cities of the [[2026 Winter Olympics|2026 Winter Olympic Games]] presented an artistic performance at the closing ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics. But due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and using this year organizing concept;  ""less is more"", the producer [[Marco Balich]] needed only use 6 performers.

The artistic performance of the segment is called ""Duality, Together"", which coincidentally matched with ""Together for a shared future"", the slogan of the 2022 Winter Olympics. According to Christian Milici (Head of Events), they aimed to celebrate the harmony which links two cities (Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo) that are very seemingly different, but are in dialogue with each other. Because of this, the segment was focused on the harmony between humanity and nature. The segment starts out with two children with the names of the host cities on each of their backs rolling and hugging a  inflated vinyl plastic globe, representing the two next host cities inviting the world for the 2026 games and the history of the [[Silk Road]] (a historical important trading route traced by [[Marco Polo]] which was the first link between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]). The first film depicted the two dancers trekking across the host cities: a man running in the urban landscape of Milan and a woman running in the snowy mountains of Cortina d'Ampezzo, both of whom represent the two cities. After the first film, the two then performed together on the stadium in a modern dance sequel to represent the history and the cultural aspects of Italy. After the segment, a second film was shown depicting various athletes holding several Italian flags and flags with the 2026 Winter Olympics logo. It then shows several open-aired meetings across the country as [[Frecce Tricolori]] flies over [[Venice]] (main hotspot from [[Veneto]], the region where Cortina is located) and the Italian [[Alps]] and introduced the two host regions, [[Lombardy]] and [[Veneto]].<ref>{{cite news |author1= Michael Houston |title=Bach calls on leaders to find peace as Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics close

Following the declaration of the closing of the Games, a video was shown of Beijing citizens and Winter Games volunteers bidding farewell to their international guests. It concluded with Olympic mascot [[Bing Dwen Dwen]] waving to a snowflake as it flies toward the sky."

==Proceedings==

===Extinguishing of the Olympic flame and Final last closing events===

The Olympic flame, burning in a torch placed in the middle of a giant snowflake-shaped cauldron, was descending while one of the most striking scenes from the opening ceremony of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] was being reproduced (when the Olympic rings were formed on a carpet of LEDs that was suspended) gradually extinguished while ""[[You and Me (Olympic theme song)|You and Me]]"", the theme song of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], was sampled when the flame finally touched the ground and was extinguished, then they started to play ""Snowflakes"", the theme song of the 2022 Winter Olympics, which was sung by the [[Beijing Philharmonic Choir]] (北京愛樂合唱團). This scene was written to highlight the fact that the city made the historical achievement of being the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games, to end the ceremony as the [[Olympic Charter]] determines and a large display of fireworks started. A large display of fireworks followed and ended the show along with the farewell musical song ""[[Auld Lang Syne]]"", sung by all member artists and the musical choir because the closing ceremony ended exactly at 21:40 [[China Standard Time|CST]], to mark the end of the 2022 Winter Olympics."

{{Short description|Parade of Nations during the opening ceremony of the 2022 Winter Paralympics}}
{{2022 Winter Paralympics}}
During the '''Parade of Nations''' within the [[Beijing]] [[2022 Winter Paralympics]] [[2022 Winter Paralympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] on March 4, athletes and officials from each participating country marched in the [[Beijing National Stadium]], preceded by their flag and placard bearer bearing the respective country's name. Each flag bearer was chosen either by the nation's [[National Paralympic Committee]] or by the team of athletes themselves."
"2022 Winter Paralympics Parade of Nations

==Parade order==

Nations marched in the order of the host language, [[Simplified Chinese]]. China entered last as host, and Italy entered second-to-last as upcoming host.

As Chinese characters do not have an alphabetical order, they were sorted based on [[stroke count]]. Specifically:
* Characters with fewer strokes march earlier, so [[New Zealand]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|新西兰}}) marched before [[Mexico]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|墨西哥}}) because {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wikt:新|新]]}} has 13 strokes and {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wikt:墨|墨]]}} has 15 strokes.
* If the initial characters have the same number of strokes, then the stroke orders of the two characters are grouped in the order 橫竖撇捺折 (horizontal/vertical/left falling/right falling/fold). For example, [[Denmark]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|丹麦}}) marched before [[Brazil]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|巴西}}) because {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wikt:丹|丹]]}} has four strokes in the order {{nowrap|㇓㇆㇔㇐}} (3541), while {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wikt:巴|巴]]}} has four strokes in the order {{nowrap|㇕丨㇐㇟}} (5215).
** The second characters are not compared, even though {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wikt:麦|麦]]}} has more strokes than {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wikt:西|西]]}}.
* While it is possible to have a pair of characters with the same stroke count and the same stroke order groups, this did not occur during the parade. If the initial characters are identical, the second characters of each nation are used, and so on."
"2022 Winter Paralympics Parade of Nations

==Countries and flag bearers==

The following is a list of each country's flag bearer. The list is sorted by the sequence that each nation appeared in the Parade of Nations. The names are given in their official designations by the [[International Paralympic Committee|IPC]], and the Chinese names follow their official designations by the [[Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games]].

The '''Water Cube''' (水立方), fully a.k.a. the '''National Aquatics Centre''' ({{zh|s=国家游泳中心|labels=no}}), is a swimming center at the [[Olympic Green]] in [[Chaoyang, Beijing|Chaoyang]], [[Beijing]], [[China]].

The Water Cube was originally constructed to host the aquatics competitions at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] and [[2008 Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]]. During the 2008 Olympics—where it hosted [[diving at the 2008 Summer Olympics|diving]], [[swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics|swimming]] and [[synchronized swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics|synchronized swimming]] events—25 world records were broken in this facility. In July 2010, a renovation of the facility was completed, which included the addition of a {{convert|12000|sqm||abbr=on}} public [[water park]]. After renovation and adaptive configuration, the Water Cube also hosted the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] and [[2022 Winter Paralympics|Paralympics]]."

The Water Cube was specially designed and built by a [[consortium]] made up of [[PTW Architects]] (an Australian [[architecture firm]]), [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] international engineering group, CSCEC ([[China State Construction Engineering Corp]]oration), and CCDI ([[China Construction Design International]]) of Shanghai. The Water Cube's design was initiated by a team effort: the Chinese partners felt a square was more symbolic to Chinese culture and its relationship to the [[Beijing National Stadium|Bird's Nest]] stadium while the Sydney-based partners came up with the idea of covering the 'cube' with bubbles, symbolizing water. Contextually, the Cube symbolizes Earth, while the circle (represented by the elliptic stadium) represents heaven, a common motif in ancient Chinese art.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Comprising a steel [[space frame]], it is the largest [[ETFE]]-clad structure in the world with over 100,000 m<sup>2</sup> of ETFE pillows that are only 0.2&nbsp;mm (1/125 of an inch) in total thickness. The ETFE [[cladding (construction)|cladding]], supplied and installed by the firm [[Vector Foiltec]], allows more light and heat penetration than traditional glass, resulting in a 30% decrease in energy costs. Likewise, the venue was also designed to ""capture and recycle 80% of the water falling on the roof or lost from the pools.""

The outer wall is based on the [[Weaire–Phelan structure]], a structure devised from the [[Patterns in nature|natural pattern]] of bubbles in soap lather. In the true Weaire–Phelan structure the edge of each cell is curved in order to maintain 109.5 degree angles at each vertex (satisfying [[Plateau's rules]]), but of course as a structural support system each beam was required to be straight so as to better resist axial [[compression (physical)|compression]]. The complex Weaire–Phelan pattern was developed by slicing through bubbles in soap foam, resulting in more irregular, organic patterns than foam bubble structures proposed earlier by the scientist [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]].<ref name=""Welcome"" /> Using the Weaire–Phelan [[geometry]], the Water Cube's exterior cladding is made of 4,000 ETFE bubbles, some as large as {{convert|9.14|m|ft|0|sp=us}} across, with seven different sizes for the roof and 15 for the walls.<ref name=""Pearson"">{{cite journal

The structure had a capacity of 17,000 during the games. For example, there is one-to-one copy of the facade near the ferry terminal in [[Macau]] – the ''Casino Oceanus'' by [[Paul Steelman]].

{{Further|2008 Summer Olympics}}
The Aquatics Center hosted the swimming, diving, and synchronized swimming events during the Olympics. [[Water polo]] was originally planned to be hosted in the venue but was moved to the [[Ying Tung Natatorium]].

Many people believed the Water Cube to be the fastest [[Olympic-size swimming pool|Olympic pool]] in the world. Over the course of the Games, 25 [[List of world records in swimming|world records]] were broken by athletes at the Water Cube, although all but two of them were achieved by swimmers wearing the controversial [[LZR Racer]] [[bodyskin]] (which led to restrictions on the use of such suits being implemented by [[FINA]] in 2010).

[[File:Watercube-Aquacube-Cubed'eau-水立方-2010.ogv|thumb|right|Video: The Beijing National Aquatics Center reopened on July 28, 2010.]]

After the Olympics, the Water Cube was opened to the public on select days of the week beginning in June 2009, and was also used as the site for a production of ''[[Swan Lake]]'' among other shows. On 19 October 2009, the Water Cube was closed to the public to begin a renovation of a portion of the complex into a [[water park]], led by Canadian design firm Forrec, promising ""seven-story water slides and a wave machine, as well as attractions for the more land inclined such as shopping centers, cafes, and performance stages.""

The facility officially reopened on 28 July 2010, with the water park opening on 8 August 2010 (the second anniversary of the Games' opening). The renovation divided the facility into three pool areas (a main pool, Olympic ""demonstration"" pool, and a training pool), as well as the {{convert|12000|sqm||abbr=on}} water park area.

In July 2013, the Water Cube introduced a new LED light show on its exterior, ""Nature and Man in Rhapsody of Light"", by artist [[Jennifer Wen Ma]] and lighting designer Zheng Jiawei. Its colors are determined by trending use of [[emoji]] on [[Sina Weibo]], which is in turn used to calculate the ""mood"" of the Chinese public 

In 2018, it was reported that the venue had achieved revenues of 124 million yuan (about US$18 million), and has been breaking even for years."

The Water Cube hosted the [[curling]] events during the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] and [[2022 Winter Paralympics|Paralympics]], a configuration nicknamed the ""Ice Cube"". After Beijing was awarded the Games, work began on renovations to the facility to allow it to be converted to a curling rink, including the addition of ice-making equipment and other necessary climate control and monitoring systems.

It hosted its first event in this configuration, the China Junior Curling Open, in December 2019."

"Curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Qualification System==

The 2022 Winter Olympics is scheduled to feature ten team fields for each of the three tournaments (men's, women's, and mixed doubles). This will be an increase from the eight-team mixed doubles field in [[Curling at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Mixed doubles tournament|2018]].

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, nations were to earn Olympic Qualification Points based on their performance in the 2020 and 2021 [[World Curling Championships]]. China (as the host nation) will receive an automatic berth in each discipline. The top seven other nations in the Olympic Qualification Point list for each discipline were also to receive positions in the Olympics. The remaining two positions in each tournament were to be awarded to the winners of an Olympic Qualification Event in late 2021.

This system was amended after the 2020 World Curling Championships were cancelled due to the pandemic. Now only the 2021 world championship results are used for automatic qualification. The top six nations in the 2021 [[2021 World Men's Curling Championship|men's]] and [[2021 World Women's Curling Championship|women's]] world championships qualified for the Olympics, and the top seven nations in the [[2021 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship]] also qualified. China qualified for all three Olympic tournaments as the host nation. The remaining positions in the Olympic tournament will be awarded to the top nations in Olympic Qualification Events to be held in late 2021. All nations that qualified for world championships in 2020 or 2021 but have not already qualified for the Olympics will be eligible to compete in the Olympic Qualification Events, in addition to the top two (men's and women's) or three (mixed doubles) qualifiers in a Pre-Qualifier Event that is open to all other nations."

{{Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics}}
The following is about the qualification rules and the quota allocation for the [[Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics|alpine skiing events]] at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]."
"Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Qualification rules==

===Quotas===

A maximum of 306 athletes are allowed to compete at the Olympic Games. A maximum of 22 athletes per nation will be allowed to compete with a maximum of 11 males or 11 females from a nation being permitted. A nation may not enter more than four athletes in any single event.  Each nation may also enter a maximum of one team in the Mixed Team Parallel event.

To qualify a nation must have at least one athlete meet basic eligibility requirements of age, medical fitness, and be under the prescribed maximum points on the FIS points list that takes into account results from July 1, 2019, to January 16, 2022.  The Points List is calculated by taking the average of five best event results for technical events (giant slalom and slalom) and two best results for speed events (downhill, super G, and super combined).  To compete in giant slalom or slalom an athlete must have a point average of less than 160 in those disciplines. To compete in downhill or super G an athlete must have a point total less than 80 disciplines. To compete in super combined an athlete must have a point average less than 160, but a point average of less than 80 in downhill.

On January 24, 2022, the IOC granted four extra male quotas while the FIS began investigating the legitimacy of some low level qualifying events."
"Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Qualification rules==

===Allocation of quotas===

;Basic Quota
Every NOC will be assigned one male and one female quota spot meeting the minimum basic standards.

;Host nation
The host nation (China) is awarded an additional quota per gender, granted all athletes meet the standard above.

;Top 30 on Points list
Every NOC with at least one male and/or female in the top 30 of any event will be allocated one additional male and/or female quota in addition to the basic quota. If an athlete is ranked in the top 30 in more than one event a second additional quota for that sex will be given or if two different athletes are in the top 30.

;Remaining quotas
The remaining quotas will be assigned using the Olympic Quota allocation list on 16 January 2022. The spots will be assigned until a maximum of 306 quotas are reached including the above. When a nation reaches its maximum, remaining athletes from that country will be skipped over. The list is a table of athletes in the top 500 in their two best events (including both male and female athletes). These additional quotas are gender specific, and will be used to create a maximum of 153 male and 153 female competitors.

An athlete can be counted only once for the above criteria. For example, if a country has only one athlete meeting all three criteria then only one quota will be given (not 3).

;Team event
The top 16 nations in the overall FIS World Cup Nations Standings as of 17 January 2022 will permitted to enter a team of two male and two female athletes in the mixed team event. If China is not among the top 16, then the top 15 along with China will qualify. In the event one of these nations have only 3 quota spots earned above then they will be awarded a fourth quota to allow them to participate in the team event in addition to the prescribed total of 306."

"Skeleton at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Qualification system==

A total of 50 quota spots (25 per gender) will be available to athletes to compete at the games. A maximum of six athletes (three per gender) can be entered by a NOC. In July 2018, the [[International Olympic Committee]] moved five men's quotas to the women's event, to achieve gender equality.

The World Ranking list as of January 16, 2022 will be used to distribute the quotas. Athletes will be ranked by their best seven results.  At total of two countries in each gender will qualify the maximum of three athletes, while six countries will qualify two men, (four for women), seven countries will qualify one quota in the men's event and 11 for the women's. If the host nation China fails to qualify in an event, the highest ranked sled from the country will take the last qualification slot.<ref name=sys/>

An athlete must be ranked in the top 60 (men) or top 55 (women) to be eligible to compete at the games.<ref name=sys/>"
"Skeleton at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Qualification timeline==

Races from October 15, 2020 until January 16, 2022 applied to qualification for the Olympics.  In general this meant that the Olympic field is established by using the world cup races of the [[2021–22 Skeleton World Cup|2021-22 season]], but also includes results from Intercontinental, Europe, and America cup races. Athletes must have competed in at least eight races across at least three different tracks to be eligible.<ref name=sys/>"

The games were held amidst the [[2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis]].

Ukrainian athletes won a total of one silver medal, matching their medal haul from the [[Ukraine at the 2018 Winter Olympics|2018 Olympics]], although that medal was a gold. Therefore, this result can be considered the worst since [[Ukraine at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010]] when Ukraine did not win any medals."

* After several skaters in the [[Short track speed skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's 1000 metres|men's 1000m]] receive penalty or yellow card decisions, Korea and Hungary file protests against those specific decisions that were handed to [[Hwang Dae-heon]] and [[Shaolin Sándor Liu]], respectively. Because [[Ren Ziwei]] and [[Li Wenlong (speed skater)|Li Wenlong]] of China finish with gold and silver, respectively, and no other skater from the host country was penalized, other athletes accuse the officiating of bias. The [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) later rejects both protests, supporting the original decisions."

The following is about the qualification rules and the quota allocation for the [[Ski jumping at the 2022 Winter Olympics|ski jumping events]] at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]."
"Ski jumping at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Qualification rules==

===Host quota===

The host, China, will be allowed to enter at least one male and one female competitor provided they meet minimum standards. They must have at least 1 career World Cup or Grand Prix point, or have 1 Continental Cup point during the qualification timeline (1 July 2020 – 16 January 2022).  To participate in the men's team event they must earn the required four quotas through the process below."
"Ski jumping at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Qualification rules==

===Quotas===

The quotas will be allocated using the Olympic Quota Allocation List, which is first made up of World Cup and Summer Grand Prix events from 1 July 2020, until 16 January 2022.  Then, if there are no athletes remaining on the list, Continental Cup results from the same time period are used.  The allocation will be made by assigning one quota place per athlete from the top of the standings downwards until the total of 65 male and 40 female athletes is reached, including the host country individual and/or additional team places.  During this allocation no nation may qualify more than five male or four female competitors.  If there are less than 12 nations with at least four male competitors, then the next nation with three allocated quota places will be allocated an additional quota place until there are twelve qualified teams.  Any remaining quotas will be distributed to nations not yet represented, with a maximum of one each, until the quota limit of 65 is reached."
"Ski jumping at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Qualification rules==

===Mixed team event===

To participate in this event each nation must qualify two male, and two female athletes through the process above.  However, if the host (China) does not have the required two male athletes they may use competitors who have qualified in [[Nordic combined at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification|Nordic combined]]."

The '''Wukesong Arena''' ({{zh|s=五棵松体育馆|t=五棵松體育館|p=Wǔkēsōng Tǐyùguǎn}}), also known as the '''Cadillac Arena''' ({{zh|s=凯迪拉克中心|t=凱迪拉克中心|p=Kǎidílākè Zhōngxīn}}) for sponsorship purposes, is a multipurpose indoor arena in [[Beijing]]. It was originally built for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] basketball preliminaries and finals. Ground was broken on 29 March 2005 and construction was completed on 11 January 2008.

The stadium has a capacity of 19,000 and covers an area of 63,000 square metres. It includes a modern, flexible ice hockey rink designed and produced by Finnish rink manufacturer Vepe Oy in November 2016.

In 2022, the arena hosted some of the ice hockey matches as part of the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]."

== History ==

[[File:北京五棵松蓝球场 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|The arena in February 2007]]
[[File:Beijing Wukesong Culture & Sports Center.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The arena during the 2008 Summer Olympics]]
[[File:Multicoloured Wukesong Arena Facade (crop).jpg|thumb|Exterior of arena (c. 2008)]]
The stadium was constructed by ""Beijing Wukesong Cultural & Sports Co. Ltd.""  whose five shareholders are Zhongguancun CENCONS Group, Haidian State-owned Assets Investment Co. Ltd, Beijing Urban Construction Group Co. Ltd, Beijing Urban Construction Co. Ltd and the Tianhong Group. After the Olympic Games, the center became an important part of Beijing's Olympic Games heritage, allowing citizens to enjoy cultural, sports, leisure, recreational, and commercial activities. It was a large-scale comprehensive project, rare in Beijing in integrating cultural, sporting, and commercial purposes with large-scale gardens and green spaces.

On 6 January 2011 [[MasterCard Worldwide]], the rival of Olympic sponsor [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], announced the acquisition of the [[naming rights]] to the center. It was renamed MasterCard Center effective from 21 January 2011. Nearly five years later, on 16 December 2015, [[LeTV]] Sports announced that it has obtained [[naming rights]] for the arena. It was officially renamed as LeSports Center on 1 January 2016. Beyond that, LeSports promised to provide a package of intellectual services inside and outside the arena. After the closing of LeTV Sports, the arena was briefly named Huaxi Live. Since September 2017, the [[Cadillac]] division of [[General Motors]] has owned naming rights for the arena.

On 14 December 2015 the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) announced that its Beijing expansion team would play in the arena. On 5 September 2016, [[HC Kunlun Red Star|Kunlun Red Star]] defenseman [[Anssi Salmela]] scored the first goal in the arena's first hockey game and the first home goal for [[HC Kunlun Red Star|Kunlun]] in [[Kontinental Hockey League|KHL]]. [[HC Kunlun Red Star|Red Star]] won the game 6–3.

== Baseball field ==

[[File:Wukesong Baseball Field.jpg|thumb|right|The baseball field during the [[MLB China Series]] in 2008.|200px]]
The '''Wukesong Baseball Field''' ({{zh|s=五棵松棒球场|t=五棵松棒球場|p=Wǔkēsōng Bàngqiúchǎng}}) was a [[baseball]] stadium located next to the Wukesong Indoor Stadium at the Wukesong Culture and Sports Centre in Beijing, China. It was one of the nine temporary venues at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], hosting [[Baseball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|baseball events]].

The baseball field had a total land surface of 12,000 square metres and a capacity of 15,000. It included two competition fields and one training field.

In March 2008, the stadium hosted two games between the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and [[San Diego Padres]] called the [[MLB China Series]], marking the first time [[Major League Baseball]] teams played in China.

In what were to be the [[Baseball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|final Olympic Baseball matches]] in the foreseeable future, as the [[International Olympic Committee]] voted out the baseball event for the upcoming [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Olympics]] and [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics]] in favor of [[golf]] and [[rugby sevens]], Team USA clinched the bronze medal, while [[South Korea]] beat [[Cuba]] to claim the gold medal. After the Olympic games ended, the facilities were demolished as planned, for a shopping mall called Bloomage LIVE · HI-UP.

[[Fanny Smith]] of Switzerland, the 2018 bronze medalist, initially crossed the line in third place and thought she had won the bronze medal. [[Daniela Maier]] of Germany finished fourth. However, following a 10-minute review by race judges, Smith was penalised for a clash with Maier, so at the awards ceremony on 17 February 2022 Maier was awarded the bronze.

On 26 February 2022, after the end of the Olympic Games, following an appeal from Fanny Smith, the FIS Appeals Commission made the decision to overturn the FIS Jury decision. As a result of winning the appeal, Smith was promoted to third place, while Maier officially finished in fourth place, which was reflected on the FIS website.

FIS has no right to make a decision on the return and redistribution of medals, as this issue is in the exclusive competence of the IOC, therefore, in its decision, the FIS Appeals Commission did not mention any words about the medals and their redistribution, and the IOC has the last word in this issue. On 13 December 2022, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] decided both competitors will be awarded duplicate bronze medals and share joint third place. The IOC has updated the data on its website to reflect the changed podium. On the 18th of April 2023 she was awarded her bronze medal at a ceremony in the [[Olympic Museum]].

The following is about the qualification rules and the quota allocation for the [[Short track speed skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics|short track speed skating]] at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]."
"Short-track speed skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Qualification rules==

A total quota of 112 athletes are allowed to compete at the Games (56 men and 56 women). Countries are assigned quotas based on their performance during the [[2021–22 ISU Short Track Speed Skating World Cup]]. Each nation is permitted to enter a maximum of four athletes per gender if it qualified a relay team and three if it did not. If, in a specific gender, the NOC has qualified eight individual starting places (i.e. 3 in the 500m, 3 in the 1000m, 2 in the 1500m) then they are allowed a maximum of five. Hosts China are guaranteed a quota of one entry per race for a total of eight athletes. There are a maximum of thirty-two qualifiers for the 500m and 1000m events; thirty-six for the 1500m events; eight for the men's and women's relays; and twelve for the mixed relay."

If there are not twelve NOCs with both two male and two female quotas, and if the maximum allocation limit of 112 has not been reached, then NOCs may receive a maximum of one quota to become eligible for this race. These quotas will be given out in order of the NOCs ranking in the world cup standings until there are twelve qualified teams.<ref name=""system"" />"
"Short-track speed skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

"Short-track speed skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Individual distances==

The first placed racer (per NOC) is ranked based on the three best world cup results, out of four, for each race. This means that multiple skaters could have a part in that ranking. The second and third best were ranked in the same way. For the 500m and 1000m the top 32 qualify, and for the 1500m the top 36 qualify. The next best six nations for each race are shown.

==Changes in medals==

[[Germany at the 2022 Winter Olympics|German]] skier [[Daniela Maier]] was initially awarded the bronze medal in the women's ski cross after [[Switzerland at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Swiss]] skier [[Fanny Smith]] was penalised for a clash with Maier during the race. On 26 February 2022, the [[International Ski Federation]] rescinded the penalty, with Smith receiving the bronze medal, and Maier being downgraded to fourth place. On 13 December 2022, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] changed the results, ruling that Maier and Smith would both receive bronze medals.

On 29 January 2024, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] disqualified [[Russian Olympic Committee athletes at the 2022 Winter Olympics|ROC]] figure skater [[Kamila Valieva]] for four years retroactive for an anti-doping violation. The team figure skating medals were re-allocated by the [[International Skating Union]], with the [[United States at the 2022 Winter Olympics|United States]] and [[Japan at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Japan]] being promoted to gold and silver, respectively, and ROC being downgraded to bronze. However, both the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]] and Russia have appealed the re-allocation of the medals."

The '''National Speed Skating Oval''' (The Ice Ribbon) is a [[speed skating]] [[arena]] which is the only new venue built on [[Beijing]]'s [[Olympic Green]] for the Winter Olympics. It hosted the [[Speed skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics|speed skating competitions]] at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]. It was built on the location of the former [[Olympic Green Hockey Field]] used for [[Field hockey at the 2008 Summer Olympics|field hockey event]] and the [[Olympic Green Archery Field]] used for the [[Archery at the 2008 Summer Olympics|archery event]].

It can accommodate 12,000 spectators (6,800 permanent and 5,200 temporary seats) according to the bid book. After the games it is foreseen to use it as a public skating venue and for ice hockey clubs.

Designed by [[Populous (company)|Populous]] and Beijing Institute of Architectural Design, construction began in mid-2017, and was completed in 2019. First competition was held on 8 October 2021. It has an area of 12,000 square meters, being the largest speed skating venue in Asia. The facade is highlighted by 22 ""ice ribbon"" with a length of 622 meters each. The second floor has a [[Temple of Heaven]]-inspired curved curtain wall system.{{cn|date=February 2022}}"

The '''National Stadium''' is a [[stadium]] at [[Olympic Green]] in [[Chaoyang, Beijing|Chaoyang]], [[Beijing]], [[China]]. The National Stadium, covering an area of 204,000 square meters with 91,000 capacity, broke ground in December 2003, officially started construction in March 2004, and was completed in June 2008.

The National Stadium is owned and operated by a [[public–private partnership|partnership]] company between Beijing Municipal State-owned Assets Management Co Ltd (58%) and [[CITIC Group]] (42%).

The stadium was designed for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] and [[2008 Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]]. It was also used during the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] and [[2022 Winter Paralympics|Paralympics]].

Located at the [[Olympic Green]] in Beijing, the stadium cost US$428&nbsp;million. The design was awarded to a submission from the Swiss architecture firm [[Herzog & de Meuron]] in April 2003 after a bidding process that included 13 final submissions. The design, which originated from the study of [[Chinese ceramics]], implemented steel beams in order to hide supports for the retractable roof; giving the stadium the appearance of a [[Bird nest|bird's nest]]. Leading Chinese artist [[Ai Weiwei]] was the artistic consultant on the project. The retractable roof was later removed from the design after inspiring the stadium's most recognizable aspect. Ground was broken on 24 December 2003 and the stadium officially opened on 28 June 2008. A shopping mall and a hotel are planned to be constructed to increase use of the stadium, which has had trouble attracting events, [[association football|football]] and otherwise, after the Olympics."

===Bidding===

In 2001, before Beijing had been awarded the games, the city held a bidding process to select the best arena design. Multiple requirements including the ability for post-Olympics use, a [[retractable roof]], and incredibly low maintenance costs, were required of each design. Of the final thirteen, [[Li Xinggang]] of China Architecture Design and Research Group (CADG), said after he placed the model of the ""nest"" proposal at the exhibition hall and saw the rival entries he thought to himself, ""We will win this.""<ref name=Syndrome/> The model was approved as the top design by a professional panel and later exhibited to the public. Once again, it was selected as the top design.<ref name=Syndrome/> The ""nest scheme"" design became official in April 2003.<ref name=Syndrome/>"

Beijing National Stadium (BNS) was a joint venture among architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron of [[Herzog & de Meuron]], project architect Stefan Marbach and CADG, which was led by chief architect [[Li Xinggang]]. During their first meeting in 2003, at [[Basel]], the group decided to do something unlike Herzog and de Meuron had traditionally designed. ""China wanted to have something new for this very important stadium,"" Li stated. the team studied [[Chinese ceramics]]. This line of thought brought the team to the ""nest scheme"".<ref name=AR94/> The stadium consists of two independent structures, standing 50 feet apart:<ref name=AR98/> a red concrete seating bowl and the outer steel frame around it.<ref name=AR94/>

In an attempt to hide steel supports for the retractable roof, required in the bidding process, the team developed the ""random-looking additional steel"" to blend the supports into the rest of the stadium. each one weighing 1,000 [[Short ton|tons]]. Despite the random appearance of the Stadium, each half is nearly symmetrical. After a collapse of a roof at the [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]], [[China National Electric Engineering Company|China National Electric Engineering Co Ltd]] and [[China Machinery Engineering Corporation|China National Mechanical Engineering Corporation]] lifted and welded the steel structure. Due to the stadium's outward appearance, it was nicknamed ""The Bird's Nest"". The phrase was first used by Herzog & de Meuron, though the pair still believes ""there should be many ways of perceiving a building.""<ref name=AR94/> The use is a compliment Li explained, ""In China, a bird's nest is very expensive, something you eat on special occasions.""<ref name=Syndrome/>"
"Beijing National Stadium

==History==

===Construction===

Construction of the stadium proceeded in several distinct phases, the first phase involving the construction of a concrete supporting structure upon the concrete foundations laid for the construction site. This was followed by the phased installation of the curved steel frame surrounding the stadium, which is largely self-supporting. This phased installation involved the interconnection of sections of the curved steel frame constructed in Shanghai and transported to Beijing for assembly and welding. The entire structure of interconnected sections was welded together as the primary means of interconnection used to assemble the entire surrounding nest structure. Upon removal of the supporting columns used for the purpose of expediting the assembly of the interconnecting sections, the completed nest structure as a whole settled approximately 27&nbsp; cm to attain full stability before the interior design and construction of the stadium could be installed and completed."

===Completion===

Ground was broken, at the [[Olympic Green]], for Beijing National Stadium on 24 December 2003. At its height, 17,000 construction workers worked on the stadium. However, in a story the following week, [[Reuters]], with the support of the Chinese government, reported that only two workers had died. All 121,000 tons of steel were made in China. On 14 May 2008 the grass field of 7,811 square meters was laid in 24 hours. <!-- possible WP:SOAPBOX -->The field is a modular turf system by [[GreenTech ITM]].

China]]'', based on the hit international singing competition ''[[The Voice (franchise)|The Voice]]'', were held at the stadium. The finals were usually held on either 7 October or on a Sunday of the [[Golden Week (China)|Golden Week]] to commemorate the event."

On 12 January 2009 the venue's owners announced plans for the stadium to anchor a shopping and entertainment complex. These plans, having been developed by operator [[CITIC Group]], were projected to take three to five years to achieve. The stadium also continues to function as a tourist attraction, while hosting sports and entertainment events. However, by 2013 the stadium had fallen into visual disrepair and was criticized as appearing rusty and neglected by visitors to Beijing.

In 2009, the stadium was the site of a Pit Stop for the double-length penultimate leg in the [[The Amazing Race 14|14th season]] of ''[[The Amazing Race (American TV series)|The Amazing Race]]''. In 2010, an Olympic-themed Detour was held here in the fifth leg of the [[The Amazing Race: China Rush 1|first season]] of ''[[The Amazing Race: China Rush]]''. Later in 2016, the first leg of the [[The Amazing Race China 3|third season]] of ''[[The Amazing Race China]]'' featured a Roadblock where a team member reenacted a dancing segment from the [[2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]].

The National Stadium was intended to be a Monument of New China, expected to be visited by millions of tourists and showcased through an array of media representations.

In spite of the lack of significant events, the stadium appears to be quite profitable, drawing some 20,000 to 30,000 people a day at the price of a 50 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] admission. In 2010 it was used as a snow theme park. The venue costs approximately [[USD|$]]9&nbsp;million to maintain per year.<ref name=""LAT022209"" /><ref name=""ShopCom"" />

The stadium was used for the finals of the [[2017 League of Legends World Championship]]. This included performances by [[Jay Chou]].

The stadium was used to host ""The Great Journey"", an art performance marking the [[100th Anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party]] on 1 July 2021."

Each nation was permitted to enter a maximum of five athletes per gender if it qualified a relay team and three if it did not. There were a maximum of thirty-two qualifiers for the 500m and 1000m events; thirty-six for the 1500m events; eight for the single gender relays, and 12 for the mixed relay.

==Controversy==

The Men's 1000 meters event was marred by controversy. During the semifinals, Hwang Dae-heon of South Korea was disqualified for an ""illegal late pass causing contact"", and Lee June-seo of South Korea were penalized for a lane change that caused contact, allowing Li Wenlong from China to qualify for the A final joining two countrymen. Then, after the conclusion of the A final, Shaolin Sandor Liu of Hungary was disqualified for a ""straight lane change from inside to out causing contact” and an “arm block at the finish"", resulting in Ren Ziwei and Li from China being awarded the gold and silver medals respectively<ref name=""auto1""/> The [[International Skating Union]] received and rejected two protests from Hungary and South Korea on February 7, 2022.<ref name=""auto1""/> The International Skating Union stated that they reviewed the incident with the Video Referee and rejected the protests, standing by the original decisions made by the Chief Referee.<ref name=""auto1""/> 

Australian former Olympic gold medalist [[Steven Bradbury]] said, ""nothing could be more favorable for the Chinese team with the judges than what’s happened tonight here in Beijing"". While Stephen Gough, head coach of the U.S. team, stated that he did not believe that the Chinese team should have been penalized.

However, the [[Korean Sport & Olympic Committee]] later filed an official appeal with the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] over the disqualification of two of the South Korean athletes from the men's 1000 metres speedskating event semifinals.<ref name=""auto2"" />

During the [[Short track speed skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's 5000 metre relay|5000 metres relay event]], in the semifinals of the event, the Chinese team fell with 10 laps to go. There was no obvious obstruction on the Chinese skater, but they were advanced to the A final, with no team disqualified during the race. The Chinese team were advanced, even though they finished last in the race and there was no impeding action on the team."

Activists staged a protest at the Olympic torch lighting ceremony in Greece.

The choice to have Qi Fabao, a [[People's Liberation Army]] commander famous for his participation in the [[2020–2021 China–India skirmishes]], be a torchbearer has been controversial with India launching a [[diplomatic boycott]] of the games as a result."

==Pollution issue==

The issue of air pollution, which was widely discussed during the 2008 Summer Olympics, was cited as a likely factor in Beijing's bid. Beijing and Zhangjiakou suffer from severe air pollution which is worse during the winter. As of February 26, 2014, Beijing hit a dangerous particulate concentration of 537. A rate of 301-500 is marked as hazardous. An anti-pollution body expressed a concern that Beijing companies failing to meet regulations were moving their factories to Tianjin and Hebei."

{{2022 Winter Olympics}}
The [[2022 Winter Olympics]] in [[Beijing]] was televised by a number of broadcasters throughout the world. As with previous years, [[Olympic Broadcasting Services]] produced the world feed provided to local broadcasters for use in their coverage. In most regions, broadcast rights to the 2022 and [[2024 Summer Olympics|2024]] Olympics were packaged together, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well."
"List of 2022 Winter Olympics broadcasters

==Broadcasters==

In some countries, broadcast rights to the 2022 Winter Olympics are already agreed upon through existing long-term deals. In France and the United Kingdom, these are the first Games where [[Eurosport]] will be the main rightsholder; the [[BBC]] will sub-license a limited amount of coverage on free-to-air television, as part of a deal in which the BBC sold the pay-TV rights to the 2018 and 2020 Games to Eurosport.

In China, domestic rights to these Games are owned by [[China Media Group]] (CMG), with live rights being sublicensed by [[China Mobile]]'s Migu streaming service.

In the United States, these Games will once again be broadcast by [[NBC Olympic broadcasts|NBCUniversal properties]], as part of its US$7.75&nbsp;billion contract to air the Olympics through 2032. "

"Lithuania at the 2022 Winter Olympics

== Calls for Olympic boycott ==

On 19 November 2021, members of the Lithuanian national parliament [[Seimas]] released an official letter encouraging [[Lithuania]] to withdrawal from the 2022 Olympics due to human rights violations in China. This came to light during the [[China–Lithuania relations]] crisis, after the Republic of China (Taipei or Taiwan) opened its representative office in Vilnius under the name of ""Taiwan"" (the first under this name in Europe) in August 2021. In response, the People's Republic of China recalled its ambassador in Vilnius, Shen Zhifei, and demanded that Lithuania recall its ambassador in Beijing, Diana Mickevičienė. 

Trade between the two countries was seriously disrupted. Relations between the PRC and Lithuania were downgraded to the level of [[chargé d'affaires]] on 21 November 2021.

[[Daina Gudzinevičiūtė]], president of the [[Lithuanian National Olympic Committee]], released a statement that the Olympic Games should be politically neutral and confirmed that committee had no plans to boycott the games.

On 3 December 2021, Lithuania was the first nation to announce a diplomatic boycott of the games."

{{Snowboarding at the 2022 Winter Olympics}}
These are the qualification rules and the quota allocation for the [[Snowboarding at the 2022 Winter Olympics|snowboarding events]] at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]."
"Snowboarding at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Qualification standard==

A total of 238 athletes are scheduled to qualify to compete in the snowboarding events (119 men and 119 women). A country can enter a maximum of 26 athletes across all events, with a maximum of 14 per gender. A total of eight quotas (one per event) is reserved for the host nation, if it fails to qualify in that respective event. Each event also has a minimum [[International Ski Federation|FIS]] points total required per athlete, along with a top 30 finish at a World Cup event during the qualification period  (1 July 2019 or 2020 in Parallel giant slalom, to 16 January 2022), or [[FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboarding World Championships 2021|2021 FIS Snowboarding World Championships]]. A total of 16 NOC's will qualify for the mixed team snowboard cross event.<ref name=a/> The athlete quota per event is listed below.

*Big air and slopestyle have a combined event quota."
"Snowboarding at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Allocation of quotas==

At the end of the qualification period of 16 January 2022 quotas will be awarded using the Olympic Quota Allocation List (which includes all results of the World Cups from July 2019 and the results of the 2021 World Championship, except PGS which is only from July 2020). The spots will be awarded to each country per athlete appearing on the list starting at number one per event until a maximum for each event is reached, except for the snowboard cross events which will stop at 24 of 32. Once an NOC has reached the maximum of 4 quota spots in an event, it will no longer be counted for the allocation of quotas. If a nation goes over the total of 14 per sex or 26 total it is up to that nation to select its team to meet the rules by 18 January 2022. Any vacated spots will be then awarded in that event starting from the first athlete not to be awarded a quota.  Slopestyle and Big Air are calculated as one event."
"Snowboarding at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Allocation of quotas==

===Allocation for the mixed team snowboard cross event===

Any nation that has qualified at least one competitor from each gender, may enter this event.  If less than sixteen teams have the required number of athletes then NOCs that need either one more male or female competitor will be awarded a quota to enable participation in the team event.  Once sixteen teams are formed, and if there is still less than 32 quotas filled in the male or female events, then the allocation process described above will continue.  If there are not sixteen teams formed then NOCs who can form a second team will be ranked to fill remaining vacancies."
"Snowboarding at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Allocation of quotas==

===Additional participation for already qualified athletes===

The halfpipe will have quota limits of 25 athletes in both male and female events.  However, athletes who have qualified in slopestyle or big air, and have met the qualification standard in halfpipe, may also compete bringing the event totals up to a maximum of 30 per gender.  Similarly the slopestyle and big air events may include athletes who have qualified in halfpipe as long as each event total does not exceed 30 per gender."
"Snowboarding at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Allocation of quotas==

===Host country places===

If the host China has not earned at least one quota place in each event they will be entitled to one quota within the prescribed maximums, provided the athlete has met the qualification standard."

==Controversy==

Parsons's speech about how he was ""horrified at what is taking place in the world right now"", which implied the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]], was not translated and muted by [[China Central Television]] (CCTV). The IPC later asked CCTV to explain why the speech was not translated and muted. {{As of|2022|3|12}}, the IPC has not yet received an update from CCTV, and Parson's speech was completely cut on replay from CCTV's official website later. In addition, Parson's reaction for Ukraine National Team during the Parade of Nation also been cut and replaced by other scene on CCTV's opening ceremony live.

In his speech, Parsons wrongly referred Xi Jinping as the president of the Republic of China, which is the official name of [[Taiwan]] and recognized as part of People's Republic of China in Mainland China. Parsons later apologized for this."

{{Freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics}}

The following is about the qualification rules and the quota allocation for the [[Freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics|freestyle skiing events]] at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]."
"Freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Qualification standard==

An athlete must have placed in the top 30 in at a World Cup event during the qualification period (1 July 2020 to 16 January 2022) in that respective event and also have a minimum number of FIS points; 80 for all aerials, moguls, and ski-cross or 50 for halfpipe, slopestyle, or big air.

A total of 284 quota spots are available to athletes to compete at the games. A maximum of 30 athletes can be entered by a [[National Olympic Committee]], with a maximum of 16 men or 16 women.  If a NOC has qualified enough athletes to enter the mixed team event in aerials then they may extend their total to 32 athletes.

*Big air and slopestyle have a combined event quota."
"Freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Allocation of quotas==

At the end of the qualification period of 16 January 2022 quotas will be awarded using the Olympic Quota Allocation List (which includes all results of the World Cups from July 2020 and the results of the 2021 World Championship). The spots will be awarded to each country per athlete appearing on the list starting at number one per event until a maximum for each event is reached, except for the aerials events which will stop at 22 of 25. Once an NOC has reached the maximum of 4 quota spots in an event, it will no longer be counted for the allocation of quotas. If a nation goes over the total of 16 per sex or 30 (32 if entered in the mixed team aerials) total it is up to that nation to select its team to meet the rules by 18 January 2022. Any vacated spots will be then awarded in that event starting from the first athlete not to be awarded a quota.  Freeski Slopestyle and Freeski Big Air are calculated as one event."
"Freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Allocation of quotas==

===Allocation for the mixed team aerials event===

Any nation that has qualified at least three athletes in the aerials competitions, and at least one from each gender, may enter this event.  If less than eight teams have the required number of athletes then NOCs that need either one more male or female competitor will be awarded a quota to enable participation in the team event.  Once eight teams are formed, and if there is still less than 25 quotas filled in the male or female events, then the allocation process described above will continue."
"Freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Allocation of quotas==

===Additional participation for already qualified athletes===

The halfpipe will have quota limits of 25 athletes in both male and female events.  However, athletes who have qualified in slopestyle or big air, and have met the qualification standard in halfpipe, may also compete bringing the event totals up to a maximum of 30 per gender.  Similarly the slopestyle and big air events may include athletes who have qualified in halfpipe as long as each event total does not exceed 30 per gender."
"Freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

==Allocation of quotas==

===Host country places===

If the host China has not earned at least one quota place in each event they will be entitled to one quota within the prescribed maximums, provided the athlete has met the qualification standard."

==Qualification==

{{main|Biathlon at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification}}
A total quota of 210 athletes are allowed at the Games (105 both men and women). The first 93 quota allocations, per gender, will be assigned using a combination of the Nation Cup scores of their top 3 athletes in their best six sprints, one individual, three relays, one mixed relay, and one single mixed relay.  These results will come during the [[2020–21 Biathlon World Cup]] and [[2021–22 Biathlon World Cup]]s seasons, up until 16 January 2022. The final 12 spots, per gender, will be allocated using the IBU Qualifying Points List, to nations who have not qualified any athletes yet, with a maximum of two per nation.

On 16 January 2022, NOCs ranked 1-3 will qualify six athletes, 4-10 five athletes, and 11-20 four athletes, for both male and female competitions.  The final twelve spots in each gender are filled individually from the IBU Qualifying points list to a maximum of two for a nation, from nations not already qualified.  Two of these spots will be used by the host if not already qualified.  The host may only start in the relay competitions that they have enough qualified athletes for.  Reallocation of unused quotas will be from the IBU Qualifying points list for nations that have not yet qualified, or only have one qualifier.  For each event a maximum of 4 athletes per NOC may compete, except the Mass Start in which it remains possible to qualify up to 6."

The [[Philippines]] competed at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], China, from 4 to 20 February 2022. The country qualified one athlete in alpine skiing."
"Philippines at the 2022 Winter Olympics

==Background==

The Philippines made its third consecutive appearance in the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]], having featured in the [[2014 Winter Olympics|2014]] and [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018 editions]]. The country has qualified a lone alpine skier for the 2022 Winter Olympics and is accompanied by five officials including a coach. The government's [[Philippine Sports Commission]] provided {{Philippine peso|3.3 million}} funding for the athlete's Olympic campaign.

The Philippines attempted to qualify two figure skaters for the Olympics and an athlete in short track speed skating.

[[Asa Miller]], the country's lone competitor, was the [[List of flag bearers for the Philippines at the Olympics|country's flagbearer]] during the [[2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]]. This is also the second time Miller served as flagbearer in an Olympic opening and closing ceremonies. He also served as flagbearer in the closing ceremony."

{{main article|Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification}}
By meeting the basic qualification standards, The Philippines qualified one male alpine skier. The Philippine Ski and Snowboard Federation has nominated [[Asa Miller]] to fill the lone berth. This would mark Miller's second appearance in the Winter Olympics having last competed in the 2018 edition. Based in Portland, Oregon, Miller trained in the United States as part of his preparation for the 2022 Winter Olympics. He was joined by his coach Will Gregorak. 

While Miller does not consider himself a strong contender to win a gold medal, he is aiming to surpass his 70th place finish in the men's giant slalom event he recorded in the 2018 Olympics. His coach Gregorak, believes he is capable of finishing among the top 45 in his event.

Miller and his father expressed wariness of incurring a [[did not finish]] (DNF) prior to competing the [[Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Men's giant slalom|men's giant slalom]] event on 13 February noting it could even happen to top skiers citing the case of two-time Olympian [[Mikaela Shiffrin]] who recorded DNFs in the [[Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Women's giant slalom|women's giant slalom]] and [[Alpine skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Women's slalom|slalom]] days earlier. Miller crashed out 20 seconds into the first run of the giant slalom due to heavy snowfall. He was among the 33 skiers who incurred a DNF in the first run. Miller however did not attribute his poor finish to the weather condition admitting that he had lost focus. For the men's slalom held on 16 February, Miller skied for 36 seconds but also incurred a DNF. Gregorak attributed the snow's condition which he described as ""a little uneven between being aggressive and icy in some spots"" as a factor in Miller's finish, but Miller himself also admitted that he also had fault.

==Ice hockey==

{{main|Ice hockey at the 2022 Winter Olympics}}
China has qualified 25 male and 23 female competitors to the ice hockey tournaments as part of their two teams.

Due to the lack of ice hockey talent in China, players were recruited from abroad. The men's hockey team had eleven Canadians, nine Chinese, three Americans, and a Russian. Due to their extremely poor performance, their attendance at the games was in question even though they traditionally automatically qualified as the host.

On 27 May 2010, [[President of Ukraine]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] stated during a visit to [[Lviv]] that Ukraine ""will start working on the official nomination of our country as the holder of the Winter Olympic Games in [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]"".

In September 2012, the [[government of Ukraine]] approved a document about the technical and economic feasibility of the national project ""Olympic Hope 2022"". This was announced by Vladyslav Kaskiv, the head of Ukraine's Derzhinvestproekt (state investment project). The organizers announced venue plans on their website featuring Lviv as the host city. The ""ice sport"" venue [[Volovets]] (around {{convert|185|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Lviv) was proposed as the venue for the [[Alpine skiing]] competitions, and [[Tysovets, Skole Raion|Tysovets]] (around {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Lviv) as the venue for all other ""snow sport"" competitions. By March 2013 no preparations other than the feasibility study had been approved.

On 24 October 2013, the Lviv City Council adopted a resolution ""About submission to the International Olympic Committee for nomination of city to participate in the procedure for determining the host city of Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in 2022"".

On 5 November 2013, it was confirmed that Lviv was bidding to host the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]. Lviv would host the ice sport events, while the skiing events would be held in the [[Carpathian]] mountains. This was the first bid Ukraine had ever submitted for an Olympic Games.

On 30 June 2014, the International Olympic Committee announced that ""Lviv will turn its attention to an Olympic bid for 2026, and not continue with its application for 2022. The decision comes as a result of the present political and economic circumstances in Ukraine.""

Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Vilkul said that the Winter Games ""will be an impetus not just for promotion of sports and tourism in Ukraine, but a very important component in the economic development of Ukraine, the attraction of the investments, the creation of new jobs, opening Ukraine to the world, returning Ukrainians working abroad to their motherland.""

Lviv was one of the host cities of [[UEFA Euro 2012]]."

{{2022 Winter Olympics}}

The [[2022 Winter Olympics]], officially known as the XXIV Olympic Winter Games, were a winter multi-sport event held in [[Beijing]], China, from 4 to 20 February. A total of 2,871 athletes from 91 nations participated in 109 events in seven sports across 15 disciplines.

Overall 29 nations received at least one medal, and 23 of them won at least one gold medal. Athletes from [[Norway at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Norway]] won the most medals overall, with 37, and the most gold medals, with 16. The latter record was the highest gold medal tally at a single Winter Games. Host nation [[China at the 2022 Winter Olympics|China]] won nine gold medals surpassing its gold medal tally of five during the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 winter edition]]. Athletes from that nation also won 15 medals overall, which eclipsed its record of 11 at both the [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006]] and 2010 winter editions.

Biathletes [[Johannes Thingnes Bø]], [[Quentin Fillon Maillet]], and [[Marte Olsbu Røiseland]], and cross-country skier [[Alexander Bolshunov]] won the most total medals at the games with five each. Bø also earned the most gold medals with four. Snowboarder [[Zoi Sadowski-Synnott]] of [[New Zealand at the 2022 Winter Olympics|New Zealand]] won the first Winter Olympic gold medal for that nation. [[Germany at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Germany]] achieved a podium sweep in the [[Bobsleigh at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Two-man|men's two-man bobsleigh competition]] with [[Francesco Friedrich]] and [[Thorsten Margis]]	winning gold, [[Johannes Lochner]] and [[Florian Bauer]] earning silver, and [[Christoph Hafer]] and [[Matthias Sommer]] attaining bronze."

The medal table is based on information provided by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation won, where a nation is an entity represented by a [[National Olympic Committee]] (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals.

Two bronze medals were awarded to [[Daniela Maier]] and [[Fanny Smith]] for a third-place tie in the [[Freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Women's ski cross|freestyle women's ski cross event]] following a decision by the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]].

The '''2021 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials''' (branded as the '''2021 Tim Hortons Curling Trials''' for sponsorship reasons) were held from November 20 to 28 at the [[SaskTel Centre]] in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]. The winners of the men's and women's events represented Canada at the [[Curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics|2022 Winter Olympics]].

In the women's final, the [[Jennifer Jones (curler)|Jennifer Jones]] rink from Winnipeg defeated [[Tracy Fleury]]'s [[East St. Paul, Manitoba]] rink 6–5 in an extra end. The win sent Jones back to the Olympics for the first time since winning a gold medal at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. Jones had a chance to win the game in the tenth end with an easy hit and stay to score two points, but her release was tight, and her rock ended up rolling too far, settling for one point, and tying the game 5–5. In the final end, with last rock advantage, Fleury had a chance to win on her final shot, playing a soft-weight hit on a Jones rock. However, her rock curled too much and hit a guard, giving up a point and the game to Jones. For Jones and leads [[Dawn McEwen]] and [[Lisa Weagle]], the win led to their second trip to the Olympics (Weagle went to the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] as a member of team [[Rachel Homan]]). Third [[Kaitlyn Lawes]] qualified for her third Olympics, after also playing in the 2018 Olympics in the [[mixed doubles curling]] event, where she won gold. For second [[Jocelyn Peterman]], it was her first Olympics.

In the men's final, Newfoundland and Labrador's [[Brad Gushue]] rink defeated Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario's [[Brad Jacobs]] rink 4–3 to send Gushue back to the Olympics for the first time since he won a gold medal at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]. The game was a low scoring affair, with both teams either getting singles or blanks, until Gushue scored two points in the ninth end to take a 4–2 lead. In the tenth and final end, Jacobs had a chance to make a tough hit and stick to tie the game, but was wide and rolled out, settling for just one point, losing the game. Gushue and his third [[Mark Nichols (curler)|Mark Nichols]] qualified for their second trip to the Olympics after 2006, but it was the first time for their front end of [[Brett Gallant]] and [[Geoff Walker (curler)|Geoff Walker]]."
"2021 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials

==Qualification process==

Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Canada]], the qualification process had to be revised for the event as the 2020 [[Canada Cup (curling)|Canada Cup]] was cancelled. Instead of the usual pool of teams that was designated as eligible to represent Canada at the Olympics, more qualification events were needed to allow the teams that made changes in the off-season to qualify. The winner of each trials will represent Canada at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]].

Nine teams qualified for the Olympic Trials based on the following criteria."

"Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

{{short description|None}}

{{main|Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics}}
{{Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics}}
The following is about the qualification rules and allocation of spots for the [[Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics|figure skating events]] at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]].<ref name=QualificationSystems/>"
"Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

== Qualification system ==

A total of 144 quota spots are available to athletes to compete at the games. A maximum of 18 athletes can be entered by a [[National Olympic Committee]], with a maximum of 9 men or 9 women. There is also an ""Additional Athletes Quota"" which allows up to a maximum of 5 more total skaters, bringing the potential total to 149.  The host (China) is the priority for these additional places so that if they have met minimum standards they may have an entry in each event, other than the team event.  If unused, these five quotas can be used to qualify nations for the team event if they only need an entry in one more discipline.<ref name=QualificationSystems/>"
"Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

== Qualification system ==

=== Skater qualification ===

There is no individual athlete qualification to the Olympics; the choice of which athlete(s) to send to the Games is at the discretion of each country's [[National Olympic Committee]]. Each country is allowed a maximum of three entries per discipline, resulting in a maximum of 18 athletes (nine men and nine women) possible per country.

According to ISU rules, countries must select their entries from among skaters who have achieved a minimum technical elements score (TES) at an ISU-recognized international competition on or before 24 January 2022.<ref name=QualificationSystems/>

On the issue of the disqualification of participating athletes at the Winter Olympics, the ISU has issued a statement regarding its policy regarding doping violations which may be alleged for the duration of the events of the Games stating that the, “...International Skating Union cannot disclose any information about a possible anti-doping rule violation. This is regulated by the ISU anti-doping rules and the IOC anti-doping rules for the Beijing 2022 Olympics.”"
"Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

== Qualification system ==

=== Country qualification ===

The number of entries for the figure skating events at the Olympic Games is limited by a quota set by the [[International Olympic Committee]]. A total of 144 quota spots are available to athletes to compete at the games. There will be 30 skaters in the disciplines of [[single skating|men's and women's singles]], 19 [[pair skating|pair skating teams]], and 23 [[ice dance|ice dance teams]]. Additionally, ten nations qualify for the [[ISU World Team Trophy in Figure Skating|team event]].

Countries will be able to qualify entries to the 2022 Winter Olympics in two ways. Most spots are allocated based on the results of the [[2021 World Figure Skating Championships|2021 World Championships]]. At the event, countries were able to qualify up to three entries in each discipline according to the usual system in place; countries which earned multiple spots to the Olympics also earned multiple spots to the [[2022 World Figure Skating Championships|2022 World Championships]], although the World Championships were not subject to the requirement that for 2/3 entries, countries must additionally qualify 2/3 skaters into the free segment. Every discipline qualifies independently.

At the World Championships, the system was as follows:

{| class=""wikitable""
|-
! Number of skaters/teams <br> entered at Worlds
! To earn 3 entries <br> to the Olympics
! To earn 2 entries <br> to the Olympics
! To earn 1 entry <br> to the Olympics
|-
! 1
| Place in the top 2
| Place in the top 10
|rowspan=3|Next best ranked athlete from <br> the NFs not qualified with two <br> or three places, until the <br> quotas of qualification through <br> the ISU World Figure Skating <br> Championships 2021 are reached.
|-

| Total placements is equal to or less than 28
|-
! 3
| Top two placements is equal to or less than 13
| Top two placements is equal to or less than 28
|}
* <small>According to the ISU's Rule 378(2), any competitor who qualified for the free program received a maximum placement score of 16, and any competitor who failed to qualify for the free program received a maximum placement score of 18.</small><ref name=rules/>"
"Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification

== Qualification system ==

=== Qualification spots available per tournament ===

The results of the 2021 World Championships determined 83 total spots: 24 entries in each singles discipline, 16 in pairs, and 19 in ice dance. The available spots were awarded going down the results list, with multiple spots being awarded first.

The remainder of the spots will be filled at the [[2021 CS Nebelhorn Trophy|Nebelhorn Trophy]] in [[Oberstdorf]], Germany in late September 2021. Countries that had already earned an entry to the Olympics were not allowed to qualify additional entries at this final qualifying competition. However, if a country earned two or three spots at the World Championships, but did not have two or three skaters, respectively, qualify for the free skate, then they were allowed to send a skater who did not reach the free segment at World Championships to Nebelhorn to qualify the remaining spot(s). Unlike at the World Championships, where countries could qualify more than one spot depending on the placement of their skater(s), at the Nebelhorn Trophy, countries could earn only one spot per discipline, regardless of ranking.

Initially, a total of six spots per singles event, three spots in pairs, and four in ice dance were available at Nebelhorn Trophy. One additional quota spot became available in men's singles following the 2021 World Championships.<ref name=ISU-2388/> If a country declines to use one or more of its qualified spots, the vacated spot is awarded using the results of Nebelhorn Trophy in descending order of placement.

For the team trophy, scores from the [[2021 World Figure Skating Championships]] and the [[2021–22 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|2021–22 Grand Prix]] season, will be tabulated to establish the ten top nations. Each nation compiles a score from their top performers in each of the four disciplines. The [[2021–22 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]], to be held in early December 2021, was to be the final event to affect the Team Trophy score, before it was cancelled."

[[Australia]] competed at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], from 4 to 20 February 2022.

The Australian team consisted of 43 athletes (21 men and 22 women), competing in 10 sports. This marked a decrease of seven athletes from 2018. Alpine skier Madison Hoffman was selected but withdrew due to an ACL injury. [[Brendan Kerry]] and [[Laura Peel]] were the country's flagbearers during the [[2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]]. Freestyle skier [[Sami Kennedy-Sim]] was the [[2022 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] flagbearer.

The use of [[Simplified Chinese]] stroke count placed it antepenultimate in the [[2022 Winter Olympics national flag bearers|Parade of Nations]] before the host nation of the next Winter Olympics ([[Italy at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Italy]]) and the host nation ([[China at the 2022 Winter Olympics|China]]) as it takes sixteen (16) strokes to write the first character ({{lang|zh-Hans|[[wikt:澳|澳]]}}) of its Chinese name, more than any other participating country.

On 12 February, [[Jaclyn Narracott]]'s silver medal in women's skeleton gave Australia its fourth medal at the games, breaking the nation's record for total medals won at a single Winter Olympics."

[[Fanny Smith]] of Switzerland, the 2018 bronze medalist, initially crossed the line in third place and thought she had won the bronze medal. [[Daniela Maier]] of Germany finished fourth. However, following a 10-minute review by race judges, Smith was penalised for a clash with Maier, so at the awards ceremony on 17 February 2022 Maier was awarded the bronze.

On 26 February 2022, after the end of the Olympic Games, following an appeal from Fanny Smith, the FIS Appeals Commission made the decision to overturn the FIS Jury decision. As a result of winning the appeal, Smith was promoted to third place, while Maier officially finished in fourth place, which was reflected on the FIS website.

FIS has no right to make a decision on the return and redistribution of medals, as this issue is in the exclusive competence of the IOC, therefore, in its decision, the FIS Appeals Commission did not mention any words about the medals and their redistribution, and the IOC has the last word in this issue. On 13 December 2022, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] decided both competitors will be awarded duplicate bronze medals and share joint third place. At December 2022 the IOC has updated the data on its website.

==Qualification==

{{main|Curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification}}
Qualification to the Men's and Women's curling tournaments at the Winter Olympics was determined through two methods (in addition to the host nation). Nations qualified teams by placing in the top six at the 2021 [[World Curling Championships]]. Teams could also qualify through Olympic qualification events which were held in 2021. Six nations qualified via World Championship qualification placement, while three nations qualified through qualification events. In men's and women's play, a host will be selected for the Olympic Qualification Event (OQE). They would be joined by the teams which competed at the 2021 World Championships but did not qualify for the Olympics, and two qualifiers from the Pre-Olympic Qualification Event (Pre-OQE). The Pre-OQE was open to all member associations.

For the mixed doubles competition in 2022, the tournament field was expanded from eight competitor nations to ten.

==Participating nations==

A total of 114 athletes from 14 nations (including the IOC's designation of ROC) were scheduled to participate (the numbers of athletes are shown in parentheses). Some curlers competed in both the 4-person and mixed doubles tournament, therefore, the numbers included on this list are the total athletes sent by each NOC to the Olympics, not how many athletes they qualified. Both Australia and the Czech Republic made their Olympic sport debuts.
